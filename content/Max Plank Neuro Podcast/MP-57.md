Bad questions, at the end what was the 'whats coolest thing about SfN?' Please stop with that question, so bad. Some interesting but specific stuffabout the NSF, which was ok, and kurt had a cool big picturey about story/impact, which was good. But the SfN distraction was bad and ruined this otherwise decent (but short/shallow) convo.
