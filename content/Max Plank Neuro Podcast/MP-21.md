This was terrible audio, making it almost impossible to listen to. Too loud and too much background. The host brought up questions being political but they didn’t need to be. Why say things like ‘we need to cut this’, super annoying and cringey. They hardly talk about drugs and drug manufactiorng but in the intro they say they will. What did we learn? Why dos Thomas hav esuch a good stature that you claim? They interpret eachother during the outro and intro and don’t actually talk about the stuff in the convo. Questions were also so bad, this was a really really rough listen and I feel really bad for Thomas here.
