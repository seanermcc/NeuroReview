So you guys titled this smell, cannibalism, and locusts, and you only talk about that for the last half.  Whats cooler here, and you rightfull say and talk at beginning, is how this guy is vice pres of max plank.  I aactually wish you would talk more about communicating science, what this guys legacy/goals/advice is for younger scientists, and liked some of those questions early on.  Getting into his science was weird and awk. And discussion on his book was weird/awk plug.
