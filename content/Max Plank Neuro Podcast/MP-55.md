Perffect Depth, interest, qustions (except cat gif one was weird, but still good transition) for this short(er) pod. Got enough into Jneuro (she's editor and chief), her mentoring, and her lab. Got to see a little of her story while also getting good insight into publishing and her lab and mentoring. A great pod for MP, just wish it was longer and not at SfN (BG noise was annoying, as usual for these ones).
