This was initially weird and I had low expectations having a postbac on as a guest, but Tavita did awesome. This was great and taylored to the specific audience of a young scientist considering a postbad. It was fun, quick, and relevant for them. Career focused so very nice. For me it was interesting, because I personally disagree about postbacs being benefical (likely anecdotal like your evience) so would be interesting to have a future discussion about it with me or someone else who disagrees.
