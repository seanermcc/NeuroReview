The title of this was misleading, I think I get what they meant but they never really talk about it. Instead it was just describing some of these techniques and saying how cool they are.  And this was really cool, especially the deisseroth connection, but I wish this was talked about way more.  Boyden didn’t come across as super humble, but even with that the convo was really good and talked about some of the biggest ideas and techniques in neuroscience, making this episode a great one for the MP pod.
