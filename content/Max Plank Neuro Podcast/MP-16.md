These SfN interviews are generally a bit rough, but these two were really good. Person 1 (I forget their name—one I thing I don’t like about these combined ones is the names get lost) was cool and helpful about looking for a job, talked cool about auditory circuits, and was decent and friendly and getting to know the host here was pretty fun (didn’t happen much before this). Person 2 was also cool, auditory and a cool thalamic angle to it. Good questions in bost parts, a few scientific and not just dumb/bad big questions, went a little in depth in a good way and kept it as a nice convo.
