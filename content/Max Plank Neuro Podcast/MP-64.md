I liked the length of this pod, got into a bit of detail and nuances of peters work and passion.  But still, questions were  bit all over and the end brain initiave thing was weird and confusing and peter gave a terrible answer. Then joe at the end made a great statement as an overview, but I wish you would said that to peter and asked him for his biggest takeaways from theoretical neuroscience. I liked the girls questions in this one (for once).
