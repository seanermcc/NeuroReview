The head of all max planks, not just MP florida—Cramer is a cool scientist. Pretty humble, very german, and had a very nice big picture scope and atittute about science and Max Plank.  Was very humble about getting the job, but the questions were kind of cornering and hyping him up which was a bit annoying. Was really cool to hear a bit of his story with RNA polymerase and the arc of it, would have liked some more. But also would have liked some more of his personal story--I liked the in depth about his recent story climbing to the top of max plank (this was only able to be discussed because it was 1hr pod, finally!), but would have loved this to be longer—could have broken an 8 if so!
