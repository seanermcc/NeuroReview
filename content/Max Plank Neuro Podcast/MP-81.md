This podcast was a bit awkward, Kiehn wasn’t a great communicator and is much too monotonous and repetitive to be a good conversationalist about his science.  One part I want to mention is when Joe brings up his previous parkinsons work and asks a roundabout question about it.  Joe was extremely humble and awkward (almost silly) about this question, but these kinds of things, i.e. references to your previuos work and experience, are great coming from the regular (and best imo) host.  Needs to happen more and in a more organic/natural/confident way to flow into the conversation, especially to help out guests like this that arent the best communicators.
