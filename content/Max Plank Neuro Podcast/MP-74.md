This podcast was aweosome—although biggest complaint is its still to oshar.  There was such cool mechanism throughout, along with awesome stories and Erin as a person and great questions.  This is a TOP MP EPISODE! And one I would recommend any neuroscientist, or even just young scientist who might want to get into NS start with.
