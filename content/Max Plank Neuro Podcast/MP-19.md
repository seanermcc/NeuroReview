Really made Kamran, a dean, seem really lame.  He also hyped up the cerebellum like it was the end all be all coolest thing in the brain, and then uses the fact that its involved in more than movement by saying its complex movement was so underwhelming. The questions were also bad at times, and were runons ovbviously here.  Even though kameron was nice, he was too hypd about it and not realistic.  It takes too long to get to realize he is cool and by then there are too many bad questions that make this choppy and hard to follow and overall a tough to listen to podcast.
