This was way too short and had too basic of questions about her science, i.e. development. Then right when she gets excited about science we awkwardly jump to SfN and say 2 mins on science outreach and the pod is over. There was a new host, who was that?  Hard to know who’s askig questions and the questions are bad and coming from all angles. This episode was annoying because I feel like Hollis is cool (and obviously a badass scientist if she’s president of SfN) and she did not get shown in a good light.
