Podcasts like this that have 3 people are a bit too all over the place—the 3 conversations were so difference and the only similarities were ‘SfN’, broadly defined.  To be honest, once you learn about SfN one time and go there once, you don’t need to hear more about someone SfN and how they like it and what not.  The emphasis on how great SfN is and what someone gets out of it is so cringe, forced, and just not real for what SfN actually is.  Theres a lot of negative and annoying parts of SfN that has never been talked about in this podcast, because I guess everyone is too nice and doesn’t want to put the truth out there.  Anyway, the last convo was actually pretty good, but by the time I got there I was annoyed at the first 2.  need to have Dr. Rodriguez on the podcast as a real guest and talk more nuanced about her stuff and not at SfN.  At this point, id recommend not doing the SfN podcasts I think they take away from the other good podcasts (especially more recently!)
