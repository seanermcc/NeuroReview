Way way too in depth and specific and nerdy throughout. Her voice and then content of voice is just so hard to follow and lack of charisma.  Shes way ego heavy on genelia and not humble about it and they spend way too long talking about it--which ive already heard from other genelia researchers. They or her did not reference a single other scientist. This is a common point that I make for podcasts that have lower ratings and are egotistical--didn’t even ref trainees. Sad.
