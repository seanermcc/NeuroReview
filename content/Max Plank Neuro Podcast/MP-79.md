I think the neuroscience of sleep and discussing it is super important, so I’m biased in that I enjoy this kind of insight. But I thought Filestro was a bit cocky and not so humble about his stuff and findings and didn’t give much credit to any other researchers—for example I didn’t hear mathew walkers name pop up once.  Questions were ok, a few bad ones at the end I thought--I don’t like this ending of ‘what else are you doing that is cool’, kind of cringe and unnatural and stops flow of previous stuff (this question is reoccuring with leslie). I guess a bit better than the ‘plug your socials’ outro, but still awkward.
