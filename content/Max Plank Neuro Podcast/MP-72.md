I really left this podcast with wanting to know his story, where he worked with both malenka and deisseroth—why was this not pressed on?  It’s a shame that the hosts just shrugged over the best neuroscientists of our age. But stephen was a really cool guy and explained things well and was very humble while also hying up his stuff really well.  I thought they could have gone into dopamine way more and done more mechanism instead of just ‘dopamine is pleasure’.  If this podcast was another hour longer it could have easily been an 8+.
