This is Ghazals old mentor!  What a cool, regular, 'dad' like scientist.  Humble, explained things at a basic level for us, and overall a good discussion.  I actually like the initall basic 'what is energy' question, because then we get to see the kind of person/sci tim is and how he explains things.  Then his stories were cool, interesting connection with leslie and her interest in neuroscience.  A decent pod, still too short.
