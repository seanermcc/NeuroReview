Mackenzie was sweet, and her humility for science and the techonolgy she developed was obvious and awesome. It was cool to hear some of her story, like why and how this was developed—more on this would have been great. Some questions I would have loved her to answer (and would likely push this pod to closer to an 8) would be: What was the journey like, and what is the future of deep lab cut? How would you advise someone else go about developing a technology like this? Its really cool to hear and see how she made it free and open access, even though she could have tried to capitalize on it.  Love the scientific spirit.
