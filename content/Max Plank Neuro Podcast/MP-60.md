Really bad questions from the host who is a 'cerebellum expert'.  Who cares what you’re an expert in? Lets listen to the actual expert.  Why do we have her there? I like joes questions way better. Dumb hope. Interesting science at times, but bad questions throughout really made this hard to listen to.
