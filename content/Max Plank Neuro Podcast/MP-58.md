Jeff was really neat and humble, but the questions were a bit too niche and just rehitting the same point.  Too focused on dendrites and dendritic plasticiy, and not enough big picture or story to get me really interested in him and his work.  Felt a bit like the hosts were hyping him up and making him come out of his humble shell and be a bit boastful, but that wasn’t jeffs style.  Would have been nice to get more big picture, how/why did you do what you did kind of questions/stories in instead of just diving deep into this specific single idea that he worked on.  But a decent pod for a non-Joe hosted episode
