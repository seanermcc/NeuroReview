This is a pretty decent convo with a big picture look at neuronal computation and how this can be important for neuorscience. They put a Jupiter/MP/Flordia Atlantic twist on it that was ok for this pod, but made it a little less impactful then I felt it could have been.  Plus emphasizing the newness of Rodrigo and his lab and the comment of ‘are you looking for people or are you a loner’ was a bit rude at the end. There was some ok questions in the middle, and a decent convo overall.  I like joe and Leslie asking the questions as im feeling im getting to know them a bit, but still this pod is too short and shallow at times for it to be a high rating.
