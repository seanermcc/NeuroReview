Peerson 1: 6.5, person 2: 6.8, person 3: 5.8.  The 3 person thing here is annoying and its at SfN, so audio kinda bad and annoying.  The conetnt here was pretty good however and informative for young scientists who are really new to science. Interesting to hear how the girls paths to their careers (first 2 peope) are made, and the last one was hard to follow and be interested and was too SfN specific. The idea that neuro should branch into other areas stood out to me and I thought this was interesting/relevant to any scientist.
