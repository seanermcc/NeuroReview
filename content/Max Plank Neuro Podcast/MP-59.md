I honestly wish joe would have made more arc puns here lol. I thought this was an overall great pod for MP, a little longer than most (I still wish it was 2-3x as long). There was a nice dance between science and story that I always appreciate. Jason was interesting and humble, he always mentioned other peoples work and hyped up collabs and showed humility. Alot of little interesting stories were discussed that were entertaining and enlightening. Also, jeremys pause and info about LTD/LTP was nice, I usually dont like the pauses.
