There was a few profound moments in this short conversation. When they talked about the shifting tides of the field and how dogmas shift over decades, I really felt this and it appears that many experts and older scientists have this kind of wisdom that often hits us younger scientists hard. Rudy also got into discussing how membranes and action potentials are questionable, and we don’t actually know that much, this was also a super cool idea. Love when the somewhat simple things we take as truth are questioned by the experts. ‘ Follow the flow’, was a good quote. Then he had some good advice at the end about not necessarily chasing techniques. This still felt like the questioners interrupted some and the weird NYU questions were off-putting, but otherwise a pretty good convo.
