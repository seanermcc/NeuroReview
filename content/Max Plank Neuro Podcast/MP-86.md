So I don’t like the way they do the intro here—why tell us its going to be a fascinating conversation? There was also a few times where Sammler was a bit weird about things, for example she said ‘the brain is lazy’ so it reuses mechanisms...why say something like this? You’re a neuroscientist.  Also, they just skip over the basic idea of how sound is processed in the brain—when you start to go through this (huberman music episode) the idea that the brain is literally ‘playing’ the music you here, is fantastic.  Thoght the way they just jumped into findings about music and the brain with fMRI missed some of these aspects.  Even with that said, the realtionship wbetween music and the brain is really so cool, and talked about here ok (although a bit too brief/shallow). Its cool to see someone like sammler thinking about these questions and doing studies on humans to think about how we make/percieve/create musci and how it is similar/different to speech.

    They talkd about it very vriefly at the beginning, but I wish they would have discussed meaning and music and how these are intertwined more deeply, a cool idea and would be cool to get a hardcore neuroscientists perspective on this kind of thinking.
