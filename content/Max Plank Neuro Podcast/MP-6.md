This is very, very, very political and viased towards a progressive and non-scientific way to look at gender in science. Way too short, and only had this single perspective cliaming that the inequalities for women in science is SO BAD now. Is this really true? Seems to me like nowadays noone cares what gender you have and actually women scientists often do better and communicate better and are better mentors than men.  Of course they can have babies and often lead their families, but being a parent nowadays can be just as much responsibility for a man too. Lets ask more questions and have a more nuanced conversation about this gender bias (need way more time than 30 mins with 3 guests).  For example: Why does this gneder bias happen? Where does int come from?  What is the actual things we can do to make this bias better?  Are they happening now? What about merit and meritocracy, is that not what science and the pursuit of truth is about?
