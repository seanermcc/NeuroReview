So this did start ok, but then went away from the salt discussion to thirst, and this was explained in a very niche way without much basics with some randow questions that were sprinkled in that made things even worse. This podcast also had a really bad ending with the hunger question and ‘what are two types of thirsty’ that really broke the flow and ended the episode on a really awkward note. What about mentioning grad students who invited him—why did that happen and what did it mean to him? Who is Yuki as a scientist? The convo was much too niche and awkward and didn’t have any flow to it. Miche did ok, but he should have been the only host.
