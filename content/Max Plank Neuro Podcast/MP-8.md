Man, you cant make vision science more boring then the three of these guys together.  The extra 10 minutes in the second episode kind of ssaved the first part (but weird that this was split into two episodes?), and made the arc of the convo a bit more interesting to listen to. But man, the hosts were so not humble and cringe it was really bad in this episode. Ferster is a mentee of hubel and weasel, lets focus on that and talk about them and be humble and stand on the shoulders of giants and let ferster tell some stories about that please. Stop talking about how great you are (the hosts) and ask better questions and stop making childish jokes. You’re neursocientists, not comedians.
