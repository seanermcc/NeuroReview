This podcast was way too focused and niche and hard to follow the big picture. I guess if your into 3D optogenetics then you  might like this, but Valentina seemed like she lacked some humility and just thought her stuff was so great.  Would have liked more background and basics and significance of why this is a good, interesting, and groundbreaking idea.
