This was a very cringe listen, and felt a bit political and awkard throughout.  But one thing that really stood out that I did like here was a quot by Forcelli: ‘Treat unpublished data like a festering wound that will ill me if I don’t get it out’.  This is something more scientists need to hear (although maybe not in this weird way) and hit me hard as a scientist trying to finish my Ph.D. But there was a lot of bad questions and cringe moments, especially with the global warming comments as a cause of epilepsy, come on now.  How can the host not call this out or at least try to have a discussion about this kind of talk?
