Mark did a great job explaining the nuances of the motor circuits and humunculous in a relatively short amount of time, and he did this while dancing around some weird questions. Left vs. right, feedback, how the motor system is generally studied, and the importance of the system as a whole was explained pretty well. But that was about the entirety of the pod, and it felt pretty shallow. I appreciated marks enthusiasm and excitement for his science and the podcasts. But there was a weird shameful plug a the end for his lab and him telling people to read his papers was silly and annoying. Why do we keep asking that question Jeremy—sets up these humble scientists to show either ego.
