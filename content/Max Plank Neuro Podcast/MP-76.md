Still a bit short for my liking, but a good interview with a post-doc here. Some nice scientific discussion about flies and why Groschner wants to look at them. Also a nice hype about the pod and influence that the pod has on him—this was a cool thing to see and hopefully impactful for the MP team that has been doing the podcast.
