Pretty good for the MP pod, but still too short and a little cringe and not quite enough science. Cool thati've seen him before after only listening to first 20 episodes. Neat to have same ppl at diff points in career and life (sometimes, here is ok). But conversation is shallow and gets weird with father part and not enough big picture questions or good questions in general.  Why 2 people there if one guy only asks 1/2 questions?
