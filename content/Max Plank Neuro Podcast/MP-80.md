Bellono was a great guest—super engaging, confident, but also you could just feel his passion for his work.  Casually testing out the wildest ocean animals and examining whatever crazy/interesting behavior they do is super cool.  I particularly liked the sea birds towards the end, and the parana work.  Good questions to bring out Bellono’s humility and passion, I did miss Joe here though I think he would have added to this pod.
