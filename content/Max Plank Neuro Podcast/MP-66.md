This was an interesting and cool arc for the MP podcast as a whole, where David came back on years later after initially being interviewed as a postdoc, and is now on as a PI. Hearing his story and process was all very interesting and exciting, although this conversation was a bit niche for academics. I don’t like having 3x hosts here—the girls mic was bad and she had bad questions. Somme bad flow at times where David would end a point and they wouldn’t have a good follow-up, so was a bit cringe. But overall this was a very decent conversation, and a bit longer than many of the recent ones which I appreciated for a MP podcast.
