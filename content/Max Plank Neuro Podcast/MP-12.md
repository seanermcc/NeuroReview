Decent flow and questions, especially for an SfN interview. Still too short for my liking, and I don’t like doubling up the guests (hard to find back who they were). I do like how there was only 1 person asking the questions, kept it much more focused and engaging. The plugging of the brain matters pod was a bit cringe, but the guests and host had some nice chemistry here that doesn’t happen as much in the SfN interviews I feel.
