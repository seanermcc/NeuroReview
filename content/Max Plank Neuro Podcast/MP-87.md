The idea that there are human specific genes is fascinating, and as a scientist I was surprised that the number was only 30-60 (depending how you look at it). It goes to show that the real complexity of the mind comes from interactions in neurons and not necessarily from genes. Ewoud was a really cool and humble scientist, but they got really deep into a single gene, Src1, and it felt like they got lost in the big picture at times. But once again, I liked the questions from leslie and joe—im liking how its them over and over, and also like the video.  However, with the video I don’t love the angles on joe and leslie, as they are a bit too zoomed out.  Should look at how other podcasts do it (Lex, Rogan, Huberman for example) and just copy them.  Theres a reason these are so popular, there algoriths work and get broader reach to the public, doing it a little different and showcasing the studio and background puts less emphasis on the guest and more on the ‘MP neuro’ who only a few people really care about.
