This was almost an 8+, but the few minutes of doubles sound later on in an exciting part when Martin was talking about mentoring and big picture stuff was really annoying and bad timing. A handful of really good questions throughout led Martin to a lot of nice and interesting topics.  Martin did a nice dance into niche science concepts with a good braod vision. The DEI stuff at the end was annoying, but at least it was short. Martin was charismatic and interesting and humble but excited at the same time, a rare good communicating scientist on max plank.
