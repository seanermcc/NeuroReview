This is a good perspective at the intersection of language and neuroscience. It was actually a pretty fun conversation, with decent questions. The start was pretty good, disucssing the langauge areas and how they represent a dogma that isnt quite true. It was explained simply by hosts and then elegantly by David, which you love to see.  I loved this stype of conversation from the MP podcast, unique and entertaining.
