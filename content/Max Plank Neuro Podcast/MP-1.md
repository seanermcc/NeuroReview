Feels like David has a bit of an ego that gets hyped up by the hosts.  I don’t learn much about the hosts, they are a bit cringe in this episode.  Tlaks like the max plank is the best (and only) neuro institute worth being at. Message of the podcast and the mission does not get through at all, id guess its that science needs to the general public?  Then why do we get so specific so quickly.  Seems like its more targeted to grad students.
