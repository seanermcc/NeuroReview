Was on phone, so low ceiling. Such bad flow and questions and awkward and honestly kaela was a good sport with the awful questions and convo flow. Felt like being a fly on the wall in a forced awkward phone convo about race and DEI. And their talk about science was so damn basic and unenthusiastic. Just not a good pod by any aspect.
