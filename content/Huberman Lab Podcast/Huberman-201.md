Huberman goes through a hodgepodge of relevant and interesting questions/protocols/ideas that he has gleamed from the nutrition and exercise space and asks Stacy what she thinks about women doing them.  Starting from intermittant fasting then diving through training and into birth control, this is a high quality episode for any female who cares about their health and well being (especially in light of doing phisical fitness).  For me as a 27 yo man, I will definitely be telling a couple of key points to my wife and recommendnig her to listen.  Those points would be: 1) don’t be afraid to lift weights, lets do it together--this can often be better than cardio in many aspects.  And 2) don’t use birth control unless you really think you need it, why mess up your hormones and cycle when us men can just show some self control.  

There wasn’t as much mechanism in this episode as I would have liked, and if its mentioned its very brief.  And then huberman asked a few cringe/awkard questions when it came to him telling Stacy 'So what do you want to talk about next' and 'why don’t you tell us whats something interesting you do'.  Huberman, we want/need you to lead these conversations and don’t need that kind of energy.  We'd rather have you ask a hodgepodge of random questions that you are genuinely curious about instead of just telling the guest 'tell us something interesting in your life'.
