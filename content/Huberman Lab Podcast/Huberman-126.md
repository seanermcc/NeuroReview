The idea that neurosurgeons are the astronauts of neuroscience is a cool one, and listening to this guy talk (and having listened to 'astronauts' (elon/jeff/people building rockets) I can see the similarities in their mindset and thinking.  However, I feel like a lot of the 'cool' or 'controversial' things about neurolink are not really discussed, and the questions aren't really deep enough as far as to what is actually going on there. The understanding seems to be that neurolink is very open and good and the best, but who says? And what about people who disagree? What have they actually done? How does it actually work?  What are the elctrodes doing to cause these changes?  I have a lot more questions and I believe andrew does as well.
