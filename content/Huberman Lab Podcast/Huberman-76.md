This pod was hard for me to follow for some reason.  It felt interesting, the von economo neuron part for example, but it just didn’t sit with me well. I had to relisten to this part, as it felt important for me (Especially as a neuroscientist), but I had to relisten to understand it.  There was a good amount of neuroscience mechanistic jewels here, like the stretching protocol where you have muscles that are supplemental (ham and quad).  But there wasn’t quite a big picture narrative to follow and I couldn’t find the big takeaways very easily.  The studies at the end for example were interesting (cancer one), but a little all over the place.  This was an ok episode with some neuromechanism, but for some reason hard to follow
