Another great episode with Dr. Becky, lets get her a series, no!? So many great stories and examples from her life and others that made it so relatable—the pilot idea should be patented lol. Explaining feeling bad as doing something that isnt in line with your values was really powerful for me, and was helpful for my Family situation personally. They have a really nice back and forth where becky xplains a profound concept and gives a nice analogy and then huberman refs some science that agrees with it. I actually think huberman was idaled down a bit on this, which was nice, but for the music topic for example he didn’t get mechanistic at all (as this is some of my fav mechanism).  Which was OK! Cus for a lot of us we remember some profound mechanism like music and then we get to feel smart. Overall, this eposde was emotional and powerful for people that care about mentoring or parenting, and once again id recommend Dr. Becky to anyone who whats to do either of those things well and at a high level.
