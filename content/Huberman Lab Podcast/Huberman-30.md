This episdoe is a really good introduction and crash course into the brain body interface of neuroscience, and how things like breathing and eating are controlled neuronally.  This is a pretty good foundational episode for later things focusing on breathing and sleeping and eating, and would definitely recommend for a beginning/budding neuroscientist.
