'Why understand mechanism?--when you understand mechanism, you understand how to control the machine that is your biological system'--Beautiful.  Hub spends a lot of time talking about the 3 previous pods here, the video is kind of funny, really funny to watch this looking back.  Poor production quality compared to what we are used to now. 
This podcast is the foundation of the classic 'get SUNlight in the morning within 90 mins after waking' where hub dives into deep mechanism into why.  Also introducing temp minimum, something that ends up coming up A LOT in a variety of situations, especially around sleep.  A classic, but not necessarily great, podcast.  Don’t like the long intro that tries to justify the format (and outro) and his style.  But hey hub was young here, so gotta give him a break.  Looking back this is 7.7 b/c of classicness, but in reality could be lower because not a great one to listen to.  A bit redundent and the supplements at the end felt unncessary.
