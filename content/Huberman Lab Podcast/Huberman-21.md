pod_notes: High quality tool packed episode, also pretty classic but even more than
  that. The fidgeting is awesome, you come back to it multiple times throughout the
  episode (helps make it stick) and its so cool how neat the mechanisms is to you
  and it make it way more interesting to us. I told my dad about it (who is overweight
  and ive tried to get to do fasting and eating lesss often after listening to you
  and sinclair and reading lifespan and after doing it myself and losing 40+lbs lol).
  Maybe this will work for him! Plus, goingback to yerba matte, caffiene, you eating
  10 donuts (again lol), is all just so in flow with the rest of your pod. Also, castello
  is to much listening back on, RIP what a dog.
