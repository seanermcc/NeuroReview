pod_host: Huberman
pod_length: 2.5
pod_notes: Not enough time spent on his personal story, and his story wasn't roped
  into the rest of the conversation well enough.  Good science throughout, but went
  a little long and drawn out--the whole time I just wanted to hear about his illness
  (which you eluded to at the intro).
