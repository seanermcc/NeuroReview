Bill was very well spoken, and this conversation had great flow. However, I don’t feel like it had near as much literature or real ‘science’ or mechanism as normal huberman podcasts, which is ok. Instead it was a bit more anecdotal and set on a lot of things that Bill has opinions/knowledge of based on his experiences. Even with that said, the idea of many people having this high convlict personality, and some having personality disorders, no doubtbly resonates with almost everyone. As they were explaining these people and how to deal with them, I immediately thought of people in my life and had a sort of ‘aha’ moment realizing they were indeed high conflict people. The most interesting tool I got from this is too avoid these kinds of people in the sense of eliminating these relationships if possible.  You arnet going to change them, and even though huberman did try to relate to neuroplasticity some, bill doubled down on the idea that if its not healthy and a bad relationship, being able to get out of it is super important. This is hopefully really good for many people in abusive relationships and wanting to get out of them.
