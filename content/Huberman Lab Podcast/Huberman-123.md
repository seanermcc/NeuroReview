Felt powerful, but very redundant with preivous dopamine episodes.  The baseline thing is always interesting and cool, and the anatomy itself and basics of neuromodulars is always a bit fascinating everytime I hear it taught—basically the idea that some/most connections are direct with a neurotransmitter, and then dopamine comes in and baths an entire area and region and dozens/hundreds of connections.  So cool.  Always interesting, just not near as novel and I thought and not as not really super focused on procrastination.
