This is an awesome solo huberman podcast with a great dive into literature and AH stories that is the exactly the balance of science and real life I love to see from hub pod. Im possibly a little biased in this rating because I listen to these podcasts while in grad school working long hours in lab, something Huberman mentions multiple times throughout this--but maybe many ppl can relate to this. We have to make our own happiness by knowing what we are doing is the right path for us. The balance of money and social connection was valid and interesting, and I always find it shocking yet grounding how money is always so key in any kind of convo about happiness. What about a vocation in science? Isnt science a vocation in itself? Shouldn’t the literature reflect this somehow? This was a great discussion on the psychology of happiness that anyone who is science minded and cares about their well being should listen to. Also the touching thing with pets and people I related to hard--touching someone's arm/leg and getting tingle. This is real and neuronal. The same tingle when I feel the holy spirit.
