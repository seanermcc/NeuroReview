Really Cool to see huberman a bit starstruck, and a lot of great stuff is in here especially in regards to mentoring and relationships. Talking about the book, why huberman liked it, and what he got out of it, and hearing green's response, is really cool and makes me want to talk to authors in the future. But i think greene says some things about the brain and psychology that i wish huberman would have pushed back a bit more on.  He did a little about the eye and visual system, but when it came to mindset or relationships or female/male it would have been nice.  He does also mention past pods, like with conti and feldman berrett, which is really cool, but doing this more in this episode would have made it even better.
