'I was a great OBGYN'.  She interupts huberman multiple times during her questions.  Let him ask his question and finish his thought.  Mary talks about herself all the time, laughs and is excited about coining multiple phrases, 'I am a boss at delivering a baby, gynecology'  Come on girl this just is not the attitute you want from a scientist.  Maybe from a doctor, but you are indeed an online person and should try to be more humble.
