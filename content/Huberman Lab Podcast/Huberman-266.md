# Review
From a spiritual lens, and a lens of someone who wants to be a creator of some kind, this was incredibly profound and interesting.  But this might not be everyones vibe, rather this is a somewhat niche and good episode for anyone who wants to be great and achieve greatness at a high level.  People who are comfortable and fine with their lives and happy, this wouldnt be for you.  But this is a gerat convo with good flow and fun backgstory with some gems of motiviational and professional type of insight.
