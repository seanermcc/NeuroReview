A good conversation with a big time neurosergeon/neuroscientist--gives me Karl Deisseroth Vibes.  But great to have a long form conversation with people like that because you get to know how they think. Helps me to realize that they are just humans who really found their calling, and not necessarily 'geniuses'.  Even with that great aspect of this podcast, it felt a bit too technical and science wordy at times. They dove really deep into strokes and stem cells, and felt that could have been more briefed over.  Then some of the really cool stuff at the end like translating drugs and cost and how to make that work felt glossed over.  A great summary at the end by huberman, and overall a pretty god podcast and a must listen if you are invovled in neurodegeneration research or interested in stroke/brain problems or have family with these issues.
