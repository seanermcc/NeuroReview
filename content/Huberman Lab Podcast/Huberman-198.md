Huberman decides to address the accusations that he doesn’t wear sunscreen, and is seemingly very sensitive and defensive about it--more than I've seen Huberman be with anything.  Even compared to the recent atlantic article about the multiple girlfriends (which he has mostly ignored and only addressed on Jocko pod, and I wish would have talked about with Lex recently…), or to the fact that many scientists judge him for 'selling supplements' (which he mentions from time to time, but has never fully addressed directly).  To me these are more serious things to address that I wish would be addressed with the same amount of rigor as you did here to the sunscreen folk.  As an avid listener, I feel that igorning most negative comments from people goes a lot further (like how lex or joe do) then spending the first 30 minutes of a podcast emphasizing sunscreen.  Because of this, I feel we missed a lot of basic mechanism and science (which was really only spent on first 5 mins or so) about skin and the different supplements that str talk about later that are good for skin conditions.  Indeed, you bring up supplements and things that are talked about lots in other episodes (BPC157, Nutrition, Peptides), but then just say the statement that the mechanism agrees with these supplements and treatments.  More detail here and basic science would have been appreciated, and less pestering about people in beekeeper outfits or sunscreen enthusiasts.  Who cares what other people think--we want to hear you describe basic science, then mechanism, then a protocol.  I felt the first two parts of that formula were glossed over in this episode.
