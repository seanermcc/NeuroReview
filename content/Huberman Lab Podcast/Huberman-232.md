Roger was just very cringe, especially on video.  He was constantly looking at the camera, and it bothered me very much.  Addirtionally, they talked about light and sunligher for like 1+ hour, and then went back to it later.  This was supposed to be about the immune system!  What the heck.  They should have talked about medtalks way way more, which is like the coolest thing roger does.  Instead huberman glosses over this briefly at the end.  I was constantly hoping and waiting for interesting things, stories, passion, love, and all I got at the end was what felt like forced spiritutaility and a setup about the hospital system (or it felt like a setup).
