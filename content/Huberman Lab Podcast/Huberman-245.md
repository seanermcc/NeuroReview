This conversation was very misleading based on the title and introduction, where I was thinking it was going to be a cool discussion on nature vs. nuture similar to the episode with Oded Rechavi (ep 199), which I thought was extremely well done and emphasized the ground breaking nature of this science that is challenging classic evolution and exploring the reality of nature vs. nurture.  Instead, this episode was highly focused on the phenomena of humans who are free divers, and while there was a slight focus on the genes and what is making them able to do this, it was very non-mechanistic and glossed over. Instead the ‘mechanism’ (if you want to call it that) that was discussed was more about blood cells and the spleen, and this was the most ‘interesting’ part of the episode accoriding to huberman and probably in my opinion as well.  Basically, the spleen enlarges to create more access to red blood cells.  Great and cool, but how is this related to altering your genes and how does that work?  Zero discussion on that point. So the heavily misleading title/intro plus the much too nuanced focus on free diving human populations/cultures made this a non impactful and harder to listen to podcast than  normal, and would recommend having on again to revisit the actual nature vs nuture conversation in more detail.
