Your enthusiasm when telling about hair is the main reason this is a decent podcast. The stages of hair growth, reasons why the grow and die, and its connection to ideas in biology that are super cool (stem cells and hormones) is very well explained early on.  Then, you dive into many of the treatments and connect them back to medication. I like how you explain a 'log curve' where the drug effects 'taper off' at high dosages. This is an idea that is important to understand for many effects and things, and when explaining these drugs Is both relevant and intersting to learn. For someone who is losing hair or wants to help someone who is, this podcast is GOLD.
