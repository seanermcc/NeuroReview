This is a great primer for the galpin series, and goes into the perfect amount of mechanism about muscles and energy. Learning basics about how your muscles function and what they require to do so helps anyone understand what it means to try and grow muscle, what happens when they worsen, and the basic idea why nutrition and training can help your muscles (or hurt them if you don’t do it right.) Galpin is not specifically mentioned but should be condisering the references and future series you do with him, this is an amazing primer and gives anyone great basics to understand the tools that are presented in that series.
