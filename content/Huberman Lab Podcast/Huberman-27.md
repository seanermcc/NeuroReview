Im biased and really like this episode personally, given my focus on vision and interest in sensory neuroscience. There was a lot of cool mechanism that is fundamental to the nervous system, but not a ton of detail so it never became too much. Instead huberman kept it high level and included practical stories/protocols to balance the neuroanatomy. I specifically liked the infant and white noise discussion (and asking of experts including chang, who goes on for a future episode). I do feel like some of the broad brush claims, for example psychadelics not making new neurons, and links to auditory and learning especially with white/brown noise, was a bit much, and I should look into literature to confirm.  But even with that this is a good fundamental sensory episode.
