This podcast felt a little reptitive to the recent Working memory and attention podcast with the little mechanism and drugs that were mentioned and discussed most, and many topics were only touched on very briefly. At times it felt like Huberman had to explain and often overepxlain some of the ideas and topics where Mark then would just end up agreeing and not necessarily adding to the conversation, for example the discussions on Alzheimers, trans magnetic stimulation, or meditation. Then at the End Huberman goes all lovey dovey and tells Mark how great he is, where I feel just due to this convo he's not really deserving of all of that praise. It’s a bit strange at this point in hubermans career to see him sucking up to someone like this who doesn’t give off the power scientist vibes that many of his other guests do.  But this podcast is still somewhat light and fun at times and not totally bad, but definitely not one fo the best ones. One thing that really stuck out to me was: Huberman on meditation: "The problems of my life, I get a new perspective.'
