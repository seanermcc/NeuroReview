So this was a very bold podcast, and andy and nirao really just jump right in.  I love the start, with the clear mechanism of the SRY gene and testosterone and chromasomes.  This is great science that everyone should hear/learn about.  Its cool that I remember learning about this some in other episodes, but not with this much detail.  But then this got a bit contentious and controversial when it came to genders and sex, and I felt that niaro was not very helpful/adventerous in answering this.  Sure, he did his best, but andy was really trying to push for science backed ideas and thoughts for this stuff and nirao was just too much of the classic, humble scientist who was kind of like ‘we don’t really know’, and ‘gender is only in humans’.  Not what we wanted here!  Some more speculation and diving in and out of the science and mechanisms with the context of the gender ideas and transitioning and kids and their minds would have been awesome and so impactful, and andy ally oop’d nirao for him to just drop the ball a bit.  But still, an interesting and bold podcast, just not as impactful and great as it could have been I feel. Or maybe that’s also just what good science is sometimes, not always flashy and overly interesting, but just honest and truthful and recognition of where we are unsure.
