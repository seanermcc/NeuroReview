The title is a bit misleading, ephasizing ‘tools’, where I felt this was a lot more psychological/philosophical about addiction.  How it works, what it is, a bunch of anectodal and stories about it, and a lot of good curioustity from huberman even though he isnt much of an addictive personality.  They discuss sociatal and cultural impacts on how they cause and maek addiction worse and hard, and really give some nice overview about how to combat addiction.  But I wouldn’t sy there are a bunch of nice ‘tools’, rather id say this is a great epsidoe for someone who wants to understand addiction.
