This was a bit less mechanistic then some of the early huberman solo episodes, and instead a bit more protocol filled.  It really harped and emphasized breathing as a way to control your stress, and mentioning of jack feldman was a cool precursor to that future episode.  Then getting into some supplements later, along with the elements sponsor, was a bit turn-off-ish.  But still, this was a classic protocol filled huberman episode, and good for people who might be overly anxious or try to understand how stress actually happens in our body, in an informative but not too niche way.
