A neat podcast that functioned as a summary/review for the previous galpin fitness series.  Huberman does a nice job mentioning things he has started doing and making the tools and mechanisms that we learned about more relevant and real.  This podcast is an example of how this kind of education is reinforcing and also makes science more translatable to real people.  It puts the things we have heard already into stories and helps people to remember certain things, like for example from listening to this while working and previously listening to galpin series almost a year ago, a few things I remember from hubermans stories are; workout 'Snacks', creatine and supplements--when they are working for hub he continues, and isnt afraid to put them away.  Physiological sigh--again, this is repeated in SO MANY podcasts about reducing stress and good for end of workouts to slow body down and for recovery.  Also low reps, zone 2 cardio, things that are somewhat 'duh' to me at this point cus I've heard them multiple times.
