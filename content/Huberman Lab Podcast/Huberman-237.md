This conversation with Chris was very redundant and similar to his previous conversation, if I remember it correctly. He sounds like a broken record player almost saying how mitochondria is fundamental to everything and implicit in every disease and condition.  So this makes pretty much all of hubermans specific questions about therapies and diseases and even vaccines, have similar answers: mitochondria are central, and lifestyle changes (exercise/diet) are the biggest things that can improve it.  They did touch onto some contentious and political topics, which I feel is important with the current scientific climate, and I would have liked more of this and less of the same podcast as before.  But this doesn’t change the importance of the connections that Chris and huberman are making with neurodegenerative, and especially neuropsychiatric disorders and how these are much more metabolic diseases then what is traditionally though.  Rather than these being lifetime diagnoses, they could just be conditions that can be treated not just with pills/drugs forever, but actually ‘cured’ by lifestyle changs.  This is super important, but id recoomend the first episode over this one to hear the details and power of that idea.
