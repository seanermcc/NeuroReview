This was a really strange podcast, and it had the fibe of some kind of ‘new-agey’ (to put it in hubermans terms) psychiatric therapy with the main principle of dissociating your ‘self’ into many parts. There was definitely something to it, and I wish andy would have pushed harder into mechanism and how this thing actually works instead of just assuming it does and going for it.  And then it got kinda weird when we were supposed to do it ourselves. I couldn’t follow very well the questions Richard was trying to have us ask the ‘extra part of us’, as the grammar was kind of off on his statements. It was like he wasn’t that good at being the guy who runs this kind of thing, but he’s supposedly a pro at it...I kind of felt scammed. The whole thing felt off, and weird and cringey, and without any mechanisms I would recommend not listening to this episode unless this is really your thing or if you are interested in alternatives to talk or psychological therapy.
