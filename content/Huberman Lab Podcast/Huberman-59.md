Its really intersting to hear a scientist speak about 'love' and reference a number of high quality papers that deal with what this is and why people are monogomous, get divorced, and have extreme attachment.  Hearing someone explain how growing up has a lot to do with it, and the studies on children attachement, also goes well with the previous podcast on emotions and relationships.  This then gives us some more insight into being an adult, and what sex and attraction are through a scientific lens. Its really nice to take the emotions out of emotions sometimes and put some science, and Huberman does this elegantly while still recognizing that we don’t know everything (and really don’t know much).
