If you have crazy dreams, are into them or considering theories where dreams have deep meaning, then this is a great podcast for you.  But it’s a bit too specific, and then they do questions at the end which is annoying to me--but makes sense for this kind of long guest series.  How cool to have one of your questions asked!  Although I felt questions were bad and huberman asked the same question he did from ep3/4--what would you do if 1 thing?  But ideas about freud are cool, while a bit controversial neat to talk about.  And dabbilng in this psychological idea and thinking about when dreaming switched to mind was neat.  Overall still good and a good very end for this series and not too cringe the gratitude after 6 episdoes (was too much on 1st).
