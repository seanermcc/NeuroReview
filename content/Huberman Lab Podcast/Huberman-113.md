This was a very thorough and niched podcast, but likely helpful for anyone who has headaches or family members who have them.  For me not as relevant, so harder to get through, but understanding how and why your brain might feel 'pain' and what that means, was kind of fascinating.  Learning about this for 3 hours made me have the feeling that there really isnt that much more to headaches than what was said here--theres only a few different ways they happened and current treatments kind of work and are helpful.  And getting sleep and eating well are great to help.  Mostly common sense, but tehre is room for science here and understanding why we get these might mean you can help someone (or yourself) the next time you have a headache.
