This episode is so fundamental to future podcasts, where so many of the tools mentioned here are further discussed with mechanism in entire epiosdes (and some that have came before).  The best part is somehow you can name a podcast 'maximizing productivity', give your daily routine, and still somehow come across as humble and not rubbing it in our face that you are highly productive. Many of these tools I have also implemented in my life, especially those that have to do with light and fasting, which have really given me more productivity as well. Plus your stories about focusing up in grad school are hitting home so hard as im doing the same thing actively, so really important for young scientists to hear this kind of story and hear some science behind how to actually be more productive.
