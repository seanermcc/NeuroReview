Damn, they spend so much time hating on Astrology in this one!  It started off maybe a bit funny, but quickly starts to feel like bullying and nonsensicle shit talking.  Just talk about the stuff you no, no need to be so hateful. This overshadowed almost anything that was good with this podcast, which frankly there really wasn’t much.  They hardly talked about the real power of astronomy. I thought that this was a really bad interview, where two people who are too similar trynig to have the same conversations and thoughts.  Too much ooing and aahing about how great the other one was without enough genuinity. Then randomly we just jump to things like optics and adaptive optics and then into Brians background.  No story or threads weaved throughout. This just had bad flow, bad jokes, as hateful on astrology and even on academia (for not reason it felt like), and just not very informative relative to normal huberman podcasts. Should watch some convos that lex has with guys like this to do better in the future.
