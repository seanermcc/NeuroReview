This episode has the foundation for a really impactful and high rating podcast, but instead it gets discussed like its mechanistic and is rather very tool heavy.  Even with the first 30 minutes focusing on so called ‘mechanism’, this is mainly spent on defining terms and the psychological and psychiatric view of depression.  Only a few neuromodulators are touched on, and then brough up continously throughout as they are important.  But the mechanisms for this feels a bit glossed over, and instead huberman just kind of fluffs it up by acting like hes going to talk about a lot of mechanism, and then just explains a receptor and its neuromodulator.  Still super intersting and informational, but I was expecting something great.  This was especially interesting and also somewhat underwhelming for me because I’ve listened to this years ago already, and 3 more times recently in the last year, and each time I kind of realized the details were not there like I thought they were.  Instead I was getting a lot of details from some courses and my own interest in much of these topics that led me to other podcasts and papers, and I found myself finding a lot of the ‘mystery’ within this field that huberman touches on ehre.  I think this could have been emphasized and really highlighted, that while we have these treatments, the mechanisms are pretty unclear.
