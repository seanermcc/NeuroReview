This podcast was interesting, somewhat unique for the huberman lab pod where theres this balance between neuroscience (although somewhat shallow) and philosophical/psychological ideas that dance together in a grandpa-esque way.  I felt like andrew could have chimed in with some more mechanisms at times, but allan kind of drove the convo and it felt like he almost convinced andrew that he knew what he was saying and is smart (which could have been biased because andrews obviously read some of his work).  From my reading and listening on the idea of left and right brain, I mostly thought these ideas were a bit hand wavey and not shown definitievly, and that new neuroscience suggests there are much less defined lines in human brains.  But the priniciples are still relevant for many reasons and for navibaiting relationships, so allan is definitely worth the listen and a wise mind in the current age of short form content.
