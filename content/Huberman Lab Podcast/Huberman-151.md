This was the best out of the conti series--relatable to anyone and really neet how you guys jump back and forth from romantic to general relationships. Also discussions on mentorship, power dynamics, and just in general how to best look inward and find a sense of agency and generative drive (buzz words big time again lol) to make the most positive relationships as possible.
