At this point, this kind of conversation is somewhat classic for huberman—emotional and therapeutic and intense.  Lori has a super similar vibe to becky kennedy, this really refreshing, power woman, but at the same time a bit kind/caring personality where they really want you to be better and do better at communicating and have ideas of how to help.  Lori was a bit straight and to the point, even if it was a bit shocking at times (my favorite was the ‘silent treatment is hostile’ statement).  Huberman did do some interupting that I didn’t love, but was ok with at times because he often commented with his own life/story/issues that made for a mini therapy session, which ends up kind of happening with these sometimes for him.  It makes hub appear vulnerable and lori powerful.  Even with all that, this just didn’t hit as hard as becky because not as much mechanisms and real tangible/eactionable tools here, rather this was a bit more therapeutic philosophy.  Still good and worth listening especially those in complicated/tough relationships and want to improve them.
