Huberman really annoyed me in this one, early on had some brutal interuptions with long and unnecessary questions that cut off josh and left his points mute. I often felt I was listening to andrew overexplain things in the episode that wasn’t really necessary. The reason this was so annoying is that josh is such a cool guy with such a cool and interesting story and really made some amazing points, but they were drowned out by andrews prowess.  This should be done again with more listening—or just get Josh on Lex’s Pod!
