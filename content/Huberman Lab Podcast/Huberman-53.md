The whole concept of habits being directly related and exactly a result of neuroplasticity, with LTP and LTD mechanisms underlying it, is amazing.  Its so fundamental and stragithforward, but at the same time somewhat complicated to where you learn it and think ‘oh yeah duh’, but it never really sinks in and you still go on having habbits.  It’s a similar effect to thinking that free will is an illusion, but then we go off in the world thinking/believing its real.  Because its just how we’ve been forefver.  This might be my personal favorite neural mechanism for explaikning why we do what we do intutively.  But I do think the veginning of this epsidoe was too focused on habits as a concept and definition of it, instead of the nerual mechanism, and then we jumped into protocls, and then to LTD and LTP.  I felt this hcould have been packaged better for a much stronger delivery.
