This is a science backed episode but never goes over anyones head.  I have never heard biochemistry and metabolism explained in such a great way, but then tied back to big picture questions and actionable ideas.  Well done Dr. Galpin.  They way you actually brought andrew along by asking him logical questions throughout, and often andrew was wrong, to help explain the ideas, was so great.  One of my favorite parts here was the analogy of metabolites and proteins with matches, newspaper, logs, and metal.  This was striking and such a great way to explain complex biochemistry in a real way.  The first half is backed with great biochemistry and some tools, and the back half is packed with tools.  A great great conversation and podcast and so much knowledge put together in such a great way.
