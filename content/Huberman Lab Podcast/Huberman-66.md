There is less mechanism and sources then Iike from AH normally. At beginning, interesting mechanism but simple, with temp minimum and changing of internal temp with hands/feet face. Then brining in circadian clock too, these themes are reoccuring and interesting. Then middle getting into the 'will', pushing through walls, setting number of walls and why deliberate is important is all nice. However not many studyies are referened, and study at beginning you ref'd is about cold (annoying that you need to follow previous pod to know this one) Moving is important and why it makes sense.  Then a key point you bring up I like; delib cold releases epineph (not gluticorticoids); distress vs. use stress.
