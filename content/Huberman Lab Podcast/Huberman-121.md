So this is a bit picky, but the audio wasn’t set up well--Huberman was too loud and Satchin was too soft, so I found myself at times having to adjust the audio throughout the podcast.  This made it really frustrating and somewhat difficult to listen to.  Besides this, the content as pretty good, I like the way they dive into studies but keep the big picture and relevance al lthe while.  Especially the firefighters study, this was really cool.  The way Satchin references so many other researchers and gets upset when he cant remember some names is so classic a good scientist vibes I love it.  The overall idea is that time interval eating (diff then fasting, and more positive) just 10-12 hours in a day, is good for you.  Eating outside this sets you up to be fat and feel shitty, which the science makes sense and so does common sense (always nice when these line up).  Overall a good listen as far as content, but hard to listen to with audio and accent so would definitely have satchin on again.
