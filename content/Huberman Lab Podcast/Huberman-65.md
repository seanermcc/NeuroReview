These two bounce from mechanism to real life principles elegantly.  Once the idease and tools are discussed, with a dance of mechanism here and there, it becomes so clear and feels like most of the things discussed are pretty common sense.  From building strength or endurance, to breathing and intent, after the tools and protocols  are given it seems like I already knew it, just hadnt heard it discussed before.  Of course as someone who has worked out and pushed myself I know how these things worth, but what I realized is that most of the things I 'know' about strength and endurance (as a d1 athlete) just come from stuff that friends have said before.  For anyone else who has done, is doing, or plans to do thoughtful exercise and training, this is a fantastic and must listen podcast. Sometimes it gets in the weeds of strength training, but its so behavioral focused and mechanistic that it makes so much sense how the two of you go on to do a 5 EPISODE guest series.
