Huberman and Galpin spend a huge chunk of time (1+ hours) talking about water and hydration.  Even to the extent that they term the 'Galpin equation' to know how much water to drink.  It’s a bit extensive, but I think really highlights the importance of drinking water and being hydrated.  For a convo about nutrition and supplmeentation, I thought this was nice that they emphasize something so fundamental and overlooked.  Then the main supplement galpin talks about that is effective is creatine, and its very convincing that this is effective to help fuel (mechanistically and well published).  I appreciate how little they spent on nuance of a ton of supplements, and rather enjoyed the rapid Q and A at the end to get into a few of these--galpins answers were mostly short and idk or no.  And the highlight throughout is that behavioral practices and nutrititon--whole non procsesed foods-- are the key to this, and not supplements.  Great ending to this guest series, sentimental and cute thanking at the end.  An overall good guest series.
