A lot of information here has been discussed in other podcasts, and indeed Huberman and Lyon reference: Robert Lustig, Peter Attia, Chris Palmer).  There was not a nice story or narrative throughout this pod, which is why its not rated higher, but bsides that they jump from tool to tool about what kind of things to eat, exercise to do (walking is another thing that is emphasized and reitereated from previous podcs, especially Casey Means), and things to take to be healthy with an emphasis on skeletal muscle (key to longevity for old people).  Lyon came with a lot of facts and numbers and data, which was nice and cute to see huberman impressed.  Of course they touch on ozempic and GLP1, fasting, and really all of the places huberman likes to go in the realm of nutrition and exercise.  A nice amount of basic knowledge and mechanism was discussed throughout, so well done in this convo.
