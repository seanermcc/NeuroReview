Some background and stories about either AH or duncan would have been nice throughout this. They get into some tools but I feel that duncan is often too humble throughout this podcast and says im not sure or I don’t know about a lot of things and ideas that seemed common sense. It was often AH describing some protocolsand duncan saying 'yes that was elegant' and I wish it would have been the other way around (as it normally is with hub guests). They get into DFs background and stories about ufc late and it feels superficial. Needed this more and would have liked more to know about science the two would like to do together, which they gloss over a few times without going into detail.
