Wow, this was an interesting one.  Overall, objectively I thought the interview was pretty good, and its exciting to have some major optimism in science.  However, the response from comments and people was interesting, as many were abashed or stunned that you would even entertain zuck in this light.  From someone whose listened to zuck a few times now in long form fashion, i thought you did pretty good.  But still true that its a bit ironic for the guy who causes so much suffering to be wanting to cure all disease...
