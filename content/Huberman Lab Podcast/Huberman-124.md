They talk a lot more than I would have thought about based on the title: meditation, mood, and how this relates to our well being and health (30-45 mins). There's also a lot of stress talk and what it does to the body and this whole convo feels so relatable in that sense. 'How much time do you think about stress"--need radical acceptance. Love the rope connected to wall analogy here--'Just drop the rope' Stop fighting the brick wall (the stressor). So really I felt this convo had a lot of good gems of points but the big idea that the mitochondrial health and telomeres and aging is so related to stress is a bit of a stretch and the nuances of these studies werent necessarily discussed. Felt that really broad brushes were spoken about them and about how important stress is to these things when It needed to be mentioned more often that stress is only one (or even a small) component of overall health and mito health. Together they painted a picutre of Stress=Mito health, and that is just way too simple.
