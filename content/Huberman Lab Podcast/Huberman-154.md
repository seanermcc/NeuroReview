This was the first time your convo felt a bit like a copy or a spin off of lex's podcast.  You got into a little neuroscience, but it seemed a bit superficial and a little too 'hostage' focused at times.  This conversation would be great for people going into the FBI wanting to be hostage negotiators, but not necessarily for regular joe's.
