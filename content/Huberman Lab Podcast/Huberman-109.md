What an incredible solo podcast--a deep, deep dive into fertility and every aspect you can possibly think of.  The way the mecahnism was explianed, with so much excitement, humility, and passion was so cool to hear.  And then when talking about touchy or askward subjects, huberman does a great job adding in a touch of cringy humor around well spoken scientific details.  Honestly, this podcast is so impressive that huberman is able to get through this without skipping a beat.  I remember Lex's advice to AH when starting his podcast: "Don’t have it be yourself blabbing into a camera".  Well this episode is just a slap in the face of Lex's comment and another example of hubermans ability to communicate science in a unique and powerful way.  This is the best example of huberman talking about sex and sexual things as a scientific professional; he does it in other pods, but this is the top one.  Great episode for anyone who cares about fertility and making a baby, and wants some science behind it instead of just love and emotion.
