This is a very quality and classic tool packed episode from huberman, but this is a tough topic.  I really appreciate how you continously reference the handful of dentists you talked to for a topic like this, as its obviously away from your wheelhouse.  But your ability to take a ton of information and literature on this kind of an issue/science (one that many of us take for granted) is really helpful. Im going to take away a number of tools from this episode like using the sugar additive that helps your teeth (zaempferol?) always using a soft toothbrush, and 100% brushing before bed (and maybe trying to floss now even lol).  Also just another reason to eat less often, which is great.
