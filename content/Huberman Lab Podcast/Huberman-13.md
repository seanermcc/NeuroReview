Here, huberman elegantly describes how emotions are results on neuronal development while also calling out and shattering the 'left/right brain hypothesis'.  This is one of the best early on podcasts, where he isnt afraid to speak his mind and touch on somewhat touchy subjects.  Some mechanism is described throughout, but that may have been a place where I would have liked more, and then at the end talking about a couple of drugs and manipulations people do is pretty classic.  This is a foundational episode relative to a lot of the future episodes that we will hear, especially with guests (Feldman Barrett, Deiseroth, Psilosybin and Conti), and just the basic idea that emotions are actually made and developed and not intrinsic is life altering and dogma shifting for most people (as it has been for me during my neuroscience discovery).
