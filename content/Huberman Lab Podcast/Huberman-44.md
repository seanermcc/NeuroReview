Some toolls that (I believe) are first introduced in this episode are repeated and end up having entire epiosdes in the future  (microbiome, breathing, flu). However, I feel somethimes these tools got a bit far away from the immune system (although they were interesting and actionable), and could have stayed more focuesd and gone a bit deeper into immunology at times.
