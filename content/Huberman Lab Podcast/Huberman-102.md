If you are interested in supplementing for hormonal health, this is the podcast for you. But besides that niche, this podcast isnt very fun/exciting, and Kyle is extremely concise and to the point many times. Didnt necessarily feel super male specific, so title was maybe a bit misleading. Although this discussion on porn and sex, while brief, i feel was very profound and should be listened to by any young man (and this topic comes up a lot, albeit briefly, throughout HL pod). Not a lot of explanation or mechanism for much of this, and it felt a bit awkward at times because of this. Definitely seems like the two here are friends, and maybe this is just how kyle is? But either way would have been nice to have a little bit of non-robotic human type discussion from Kyle. This was a bit less jargony then the last episode, but the lack of mechanism and zoomed in nature of it (which is ok for the title of this pod) made it not as well rated (last episode with Kyle was a 7.8/10).
