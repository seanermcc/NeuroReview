Originally rated at a 9.6 more than a year ago--but now after relistening this wasn’t THAT profound.  But this podcast shows a beatufiul love between two relatively stoic scientists in multiple ways.  Especially with the true concern that Huberman has for lex for when he went to Ukraine and now that he is ok, hubermans genuine gratefulness.  It was also so great to listen to some of Lex's goals and dreams after hearing him on podcasts for hundreds of hours.  So those two reasons gave this a really high rating at beginning, but I feel it wasn’t that good as I think it could have gone on way way longer, and more episodes with these two is highly encouraged.
