This was a very specific and niched episode with some very humble wisdome about how to be truly great at something.  It reminded me a bit of the Josh Waitzkin ([[Huberman-228]]) episode, where it had alot of potential but just didnt hit hard on the backstory and big ideas.  It was very specific to climbing and its techniques and ideas, which was clearly not Hubermans expertise, so when he talked to much it was a bit annoying.  But it was cool to learn about Alex's story, just a bit cringey and weird to have huberman as such a big fan of someone who was so humble and not really liking the stardom.
