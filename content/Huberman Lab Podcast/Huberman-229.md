Ellen and Andy had a bit of some tension at the beginning, and it reminded me of previous episodes with older classic people.  Seems like huberman tries to lead/dominate the convo, and ellen wasn’t having it.  After 30/45 mins of this, huberman gets the message and lets ellen go, and the convo gets a lot more tolerable and super interesting.  Hearing her stories and way her mind works really shows the heart and essence of science---someone who deeply cares about understanding and humanity and truth.  The way she pioneered a field based off of outside the box thinking and not being afraid to be herself is really powerful and inspiring.  Overwhelmingly good comment here, as people seemed to love her, but not that popular for some reason.  But the idea that our mindset is so powerful is a resounding theme in the HL podcast, and seeing Ellen firsthand, the person who pioneered this field, is really cool.  Also really cool because she is the mentor of Anna Lembke, who was a previous guest (ep 33).
