This is a kind of weird and all over the place episode that is roping together a few diffeernt ideas that are key to other episodes, especially the recent neuroplasticity ones.  Those really show the mechanism more, and this episode is a bit too jargony.  (CPGs for example).  I had a hard time listening to it, and would have liiked it if it got a bit more big picture.  Or honestly a bit shorter.  I don’t know exactly what was wrong, but it was just a bit off and eh.
