These gut neurons with hands that diego discovered are really cool (neuropods I think?  Check for name).  But the whole idea here is that we have neurons throghout our gut system that communicate with our brain and body, and I've heard this multiple times and each time its fascinating and somewhat mind blowing. Then hearng some of diegos story and how he got into science was good and made him memorable (south america, poor/humble beginnings). Plus 2x he says 'the words we have to describe this are bad', when talking about some nuanced concepts that are generalized in neuroscience. I get this same feeling listening to physicicsts or reading technical papers and I love when scientists think/say this. And especially since diego actually named something and wants to make it better was good. Cool also how he has a low key podcast but noone knows about it and huberman didn’t suck it off (like he does with some other sci communicators) and just said a quick thing at the end.
