This conversation might have the highest concentration of actionable, science based protocols for strength and hypertrophy (growing muscles) of all time.  And galpin does not skip a beat a single time.  The two manage to put some fun and humor between suggestion after suggestion of how you should and should not do when strength training.  From number of reps, amount of reps, rest, warming up, cold, and even a little nutrition and supplement teaser (For future episodes).  They do some nice mechanism at the beginning, and huberman tries to bring in some neuroscience, but its too tough with how good galpin is at just giving the straightforward tool for what to do.    My favorite part: most of the answer to the question of how you should do a workout was 'It depends on your goal and who you are'.  Which is life. This is a great episode for anyone serious about strength training and lifting and working out.
