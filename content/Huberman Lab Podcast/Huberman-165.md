So fun and exciting to see andrew so curious and also incorrect/wrong with some of his ideas. This is the best part of sicence; humble scientists, and it only comes when someone is willing to speak out and make mistakes (most scientists who are senior will rarely do this). The ability to ask questions, make comments, and be wrong with humility is a lost art, and its shown great from andrew here. Young scientists today are so scare to do this, and huberman gives us a glimpse of how you can be inquistive, creative, and engaged while making mistakes that are absolutely ok and even encouraged.  Together, Robert and Andrew touch on a a variety of controversial aspects of food and the 'food industry', and Robert makes a bold claim that the food industry is as bad as the tobacco industry when it comes to health.  The way he speaks is fearless and inspiring, and who would have though there would be so much drama on the topic of sugar in our food.
