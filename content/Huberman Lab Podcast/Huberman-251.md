This podcast started off really strong, with a very interesting point and focus about protein and its relationship to losing weight.  This was well nuanced and it felt right up Alans wheelhouse, where he indeed made a lot of references to studies, and a few authors even, who show how when and what protein you get doesn’t really matter as much as how much you get.  Hubermans questions were a bit convoluted and weird even at the beginning here—often very nuanced and focused and anecdotal towards experiences that he or those he knows have had.  And then later on huberman takes this into the full when we get into supplements, working out, and alans personal life.  Huberman continuously was annoying with his questions, said multiple times that ‘we’d get back to this’, but they don’t, and then even when they talk about alchohol he tries to get a bit combatitve when alan was just talking about red wine—something huberman has hyped up previously with those of the likes of david sinclaire.  Then getting into alans personal routine was just so cringe, as huberman kept saying and asking if this was the best thing, and alan kept saying ‘well it works for me cus I like it’.  Like not everyone does every single thing that is optimal or best, sometimes life and humanity gets in the way.  It felt annoyingly combatitive and contrary, when instead it should have just been two bro’s broing out about nutrition and health.  Less directed questions and more open enders would have made this great and would have helped me get to know alan better.
