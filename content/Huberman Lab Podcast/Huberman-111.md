This podcast was interesting and somewhat in the weeds of women health as far as tools and optimization goes. However, occasional gems are hidden underneath some of these female specific things regarding health generally, both mental and physical. For example the idea of constipation as a more general and almost phychological problem is interesting. Sara likes to jump back and forth from 'science' to her ideas and more fun convo, but the way she dances around and is especially policitically correct by announcing things like gender and patriacharies often is a bit of a turnoff in my opinion. Plus andrew never pushes on those points, which is annoying as a listener.
