In the nature of good science, this podcast was great as controversy was adressed and discussed respectfully. But this might have been THE MOST interruptions i've ever seen from huberman in a podcast, and honestly matthew handles it great. It felt like AH was constantly putting in his two cents to add a point or direct the dialgoue towards the next point, and Matthew wasn't able to finish his thought multiple times. I wonder is this because hub was nervous? Its difficult to handle conflict and this may have been the way it was acted out in the podcast--through a nervous andrew who spoke up way more than he usually does. Much of the science and ideas discussed were interesting, especially at the beginning. Understand the mechanism by which THC works has fascinated me multiple times, and once again matthew explains it very elegantly. But the controversial points were not discussed in the best manner, i felt it could have been laid out more clearly exactly where mathew had issues and huberman could have explained exactly what he said before. Instead these were kind of glossed over at times and then the convo shifted to something next. I listened to this 2x to make sure that i wasnt just seeing a few anecdotal huberman butt ins, but it definitely happened way more than normal here. Huberman, just because someone disagrees with you and isnt nice about it doesnt mean you need to change who you are. Just be yourself. The next time you do this kind of a podcast addressing issues (which i hope you do in the future), try to keep in mind that its imporant to let the haters speak! Would actually love to see matthew on again in the future and maybe a little less science and a little more of the controversial story explained for us.
