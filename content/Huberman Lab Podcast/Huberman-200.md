This was a bit overhyped I felt, but also kind of well times with the recent (~2 month ago) solo huberman podcast on back pain.  I really wish this kind of timing of episodes would happen with more impactful/exciting/viral topics like: mindfullness/emotion/meditation, weed controversy (2+ years between them), or even brian/gut and nutrition.  All of these topics are relativel scattered, while a nice back to back was made for back pain, a bit silly.  The best parts of this conversation were huberman butting in with his own anecdotes and stories.  Stuart did not give off humble or passionate vibes, and honestly seemed a bit bored.  Was hoping for a lot more considering how hyped up he was in the solo podcast.
