This guy has a real interesting outlook on his science and a big picture vibe that is really interesting.    But at times this was hard to follow, the camera wasn’t really on ido very well so we couldn’t really see or feel the passion in his voice a lot--his accent didn’t help.  But it was obvious that the guy was a deep and broad thinker and this was really unexpected from a convo where I thought it was just going to be more protocol and movement (literally) based.  Instead it had a culture and neuroplasticity vibe that connected the brain and body and obviuosly made huberman really excited, which made this convo a bit more interesting.  A good one along the topic of exercise and movement, way better than the previous stretching pod imo, but could have been done better with a more narrative and better big picture questions from huberman.
