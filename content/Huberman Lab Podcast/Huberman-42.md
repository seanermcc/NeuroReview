This episode started off with a list of supplements a very little mechanism, so not strong and really playing into the ‘selling supplements’ idea that many scientists have problem with HL.  Bu then this turned into neural mechanisms of how taste is percieved and how the different taste receptors work.  Then this dove into how we can use this to alter the brain and got into some really cool ideas about altering our taste and preference circuits.  There were many great references and names of people (lane norton and idgeo borjez, for example, future episodes #193, 204), and did a great job of mention human vs mice studies (and emphasizing mice studies with a caveat).  Touching on diets and controversial nutrition was also nice, and really saved the back half of this episode along with the mechanism.  This got more classic and more foundational later on, and I would have loved this at the start and the supplements on the backend.  An ok episode, less supplements would have made it great.
