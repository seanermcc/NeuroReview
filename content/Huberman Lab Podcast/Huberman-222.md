This was a really cool insight into andrews life that balanced emotions, fact, truth, and family elegantly throughout. For anyone that knows about hubermans upbringing and stories and has listened to a few episodes, this is a great one to stumble into. Not just for andrew, the convo was interesting objectively to hear about the life of a physicist who became one against odds and his parents wishes. This pod sheds a beautiful light on Andrew and his dads relationship, which can sometimes seem not ideal with some of Andrews backstory. Bernardo was so beautifully opinionated and direct and honest, and it makes sense how his son became a scientist after hearing him speak and seeing his mindset. I loved the discussion on god, on being a scientist and loving work, on his faimly, and on andy’s upbringing.. If you like huberman, this is a must listen.
