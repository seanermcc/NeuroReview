pod_notes: 'Agency and gratitude.  These definitely come across.  But a lot of this
  conversation feels a little redundent to some others, and I wish you and dr conti
  would tell a bit more specific stories about your own livs instead of constantly
  making up scenarios of others.  When you do mention your own stories andrew, its
  powerful, but feels a bit superficial.  What about your own experiences has made
  you feel a sense of agency and gratitude?  '
