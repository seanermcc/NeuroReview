This conversation I felt was a bit off, and could have been way better if it got into more science and mechanism and studies.  Instead it was just a lot of random questions that huberman was interested in about animals.  Sure, the tiger story was kinda wild and cool, but karolina’s answers were always so simple and super low level, like there was very little insight or interesting things to take away from this episode besides ‘huberman likes animals’, which anyone who’s listened to other episodes already knew.
