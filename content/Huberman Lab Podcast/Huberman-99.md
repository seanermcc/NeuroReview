Chris is an outspoken and well spoken doctor who is pioneering keto diet for psychiatric illnessess.  He has a lot of powerful anectdotal stories, and mechanism, that gives his theories strength and backing.  The nuance and not just blind faith in keto diet to help ppl was good.  Chris referenced many studies but didn’t say many names of ppl in the field which was ok, and it seemed like a lot of chris/huberman were just begging for more studies.  The politics of science and realities of treating patients came through this podcast and was interesting as well.  And the idea that metabolic synrdome and obesity are brain/mental illnessess is kind of profound and scattered throughout this podcast, but never explicitly stated.  Would have been nice, the environmental vs. genetic talk of being fat.
