The topic, NMDA specific pathway for longevity, was too specific and focused for an entire episode in my opinion.  But then randomly after discussing this some for 30-45 mins, with a nice background/story, huberman starts asking some willy nilly questions that gets peter off topic and very personal.   Then randomly talking about what supplements they use and random stuff.  Would rather have more interesting/fun questions that you did on the last pod with him.  This entire pod felt a bit weird--whats with the hat peter?  Theres been a run of a handful of weird/not super impactful pods--time to have a big guy on.  Lets get Faucci, Nobel Prize winners (I like wilzcheck, Torsten Wiesel!), more psychedelic/weed/fentanyl people (what about opium chrisis person, not sure who on top of my head), or even have karl deisseroth, David Sinclair, Jocko, or even rogan on.  Your in a bit of a rabbit hole as of late (exercise/back pain/nutrition), lets get a big name and get back on track with super badass podcasts!
