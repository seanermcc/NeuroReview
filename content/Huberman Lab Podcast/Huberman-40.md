While this convo was neat to see huberman be a bit starstruck, as if you didn’t know huberman got into science learning about temp and craig is a beast in the field. However the convo was a bit all aover and not necessarily actionable (although hubermans other pods on heat and cold definitely are). It was hard to get through this convo compared to some of your others, as this is a very soft and short episode relative to some of those. While it is indearing and intersting to see how much huberman envys and likes craig, it doesn’t feel like that envy is deserved with just this episode considered. More of the history between the two of you and the reasons you like/admire Craig would have been more helpful and fun for this convo.
