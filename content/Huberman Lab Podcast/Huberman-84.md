pod_notes: 'This is such a classic huberman episode.  Such simple and elegant explanation
  of practicle tools and behaviors that we can all implement to gain better sleep.  You
  gotta love the emphasis on sunlight--at this point if you havnt heard the Huberman
  shpeal on getting light 30-60mins after waking then you must be deaf.  But somehow
  you bring this information across in a way that we can still feel your excitement
  and feel that we are learning something still, even if we''ve heard this information
  multiple times before.  '
