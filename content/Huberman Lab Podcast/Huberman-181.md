What a cool look into the mind of a NAVY seal, who is also just a genuinely good and interesting guy.  The beginning hour or so really sets up the emotion and PTSD and drama and hero’s journey that is discussed later, because you get to walk through some of the tough and badass and incredible stuff coleman went through in his childhood, training, and in combat.  But then this shifts when we talk about Dave, his friend/mentor who died in battle, and Andy does an awesome job getting into the pain and trauma and hurt that coleman had and went through.  Even doing some relating of his own when talking about depression and suicide, it was crazy cool to see the soft and emotional side of both of these guys, and especially coleman.  Really made you feel like if these guys ask for help and don’t have the ability to fight through mental stress and issues, who the heck do any of us think we are trying to do so.  This is a great episode for anyone fighting metnal health issues or if they know anyone who is, especially men and if they think they are tough.
