Christopher does a great job of referencing studies throughout, but it makes it for a more difficult conversastion to listen to.  But a lot of good pieces are here, espeically regarding meat and sustainability and processed foods and what it means.  This is a good 2nd or later episode on nutrition, not a great start.  They reference many of the other previous guests who discuss nutrition in detail, (Peter Attia, Gabriel Lyon, Layne Norton)  and so all of those are prolly better places to start.  Because Christopher is a bit too technical and sciency for a common listener.  A biolgoical scientist should listen to this, but not for everyone.
