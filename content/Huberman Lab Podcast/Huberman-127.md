This was a very nice tool based podcast, where vizualization is the tool.  And this is nailed into mechanism in a good way, thinking about how we visualize things in our brain and what that actually means for our neural circuits as a foundation.  Then, what we can do to visualize things in our every day and in important/stressful things to try and use visualization to help us succeed.  This actually felt a bit short and other episodes on the mind and meditation and free will go well with this one.
