These guys are the definition of dudes that are big and care about how they look and also care about science and what it means and have used it to make their own health better.  They dive right into it and jump all over often, but many of the topics are very relevant to anyone, and especially to people that lift weights and care about their health.  The cholesterol portion is interesting and a good example, 'diet cholesterol is not the same thing as cholesterol in your food' an interesting idea.  It seems that peter is a more outspoken person as far as calling out NIH or other big picture things that are wrong that might make people not like him, and he kind of eggs huberman on here at times.  But overall, not a good enough narrative for 8+ but good science and paper refs (not enough names of scientists though).
