Increasing adrenaline promotes learning, decreasing reduces it.  This was profound and is stated very clearly in this podcast.  Memory occurs when things are repeated, and this changes the neruochemicals that are present during that experience.  The more that you do something while you are focused (and have more adrenaline) the less you have to do something to learn it.  I feel this idea is somewhat obvious and kind of the 'practice make perfect' mentality, but super cool to hear it explain mechanistically with neural circuits and neurotransmitters.  Really helps to make concrete the idea that you can change how much/well you learn, which then gives us the autonomy to change our intelligence.  Being smart isnt a trait, it’s a verb.  This podcast then gives us some actionable tools you can try to improve your focus and learn better.
