Andy (as Charan calls him) and Charan go way back, which already makes this convo a little fun/exciting from the beginning. You can tell they are friendly, and seeing/hearing a professional/engaguing conversation between these two reminds me of why these podcasts are so interesting and valuable. I feel these guys would never have a long, nuanced conversation like this unless its in this context. They dive in and out of complex ideas around memory, with some cool emphasis on dopamine and then into other areas of the brain that are important for memory and how it works. i like how huberman mentions alot of points/pushbacks on some of Charans claims and charan holds strong, making for a nice nuanced dialouge. They then touch on psychadelics and plasticity and diseases at the end, and close out with some fun punk rock related ideas they both love. Overall a great balance of story and science that we love to see from the huberman lab podcast.
