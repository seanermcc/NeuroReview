Why did we talk so long at beginning about cold exposure study?  Weird/annoying. The basic science here about water is gold, especially for scientists.  Its something we learned about in HS/college, but never really talk about again.  But is key in pretty much thinking about anything cellularly--water is everywhere, and key.  The connection between ROS and water was awesome, I never really realized this but its super necessary to think about.  When thinking about drugs, compounds, or anything biochemical, thinking hydrophobic/hydrophilic and how this interacts with cells and membranes is key--and having a good basic understanding of water's properties is great.  I got the feeling listeing to this portion that its just so amazing how important and useful water is to our biochemistry.  Then later in the episode we get into classic huberman tools about water and a bit overephasis on ways to filter and how to do this I felt.  But as usual I appreciate the way some minor cost, low cost, and no cost tools are brought up.  The controversy here comes from the idea that some people are very picky about filtering water and importance of pH balance and fluoride, and huberman elegantly picks apart these details and gives us his scientific opinion about how we should think about these ideas.
