While this was so up my alley personaly, it was a bit too cringe at times.  You both were a bit starstruck that it made the convo feel somewhat forced at times. While still good, I think you could definitely do this again and hit some harder hitting questions, especially in the realm of science and scientific communication.  You both are such powerhouses in neuroscience and in scientific communication, and from knowing you both, i feel like you didnt put your best foots forward here. think you guys being cute to eachother is fun personally, but the impact that it has as a listener makes it feel a bit cringy.
