These kinds of conversations with fellow ‘bro scientists’ or those academics who have really practiced what they preach, as huberman does, make for great conversations, and this is another good one.  Felt like a convo like this hasn’t happened in a while, so it was a good mix into the recent all over the place pods that have been around.  Michael is the classic ‘live in the moment’, ‘stay off your phone’, ‘do hard things’, person, so much so that this is what he has done for his career, writing books and doing (some) studies on mindset and motivation.  But besides some minor science on dopamine and motivation and work ethic, what made this conversation more powerful was the dive into michaels life and his past and his current daily routine that really show how what he has learned changed his life, made him a better person and husband and scientist, and allowed him to achieve things like writing a book and being an overall strong willed and strong minded person.  Seeing this come out in the conversation was powerful and really put some impact onto the words these guys were discussing.
