Stuart had been hyped up in the past by huberman and others, so this was sort of a long time coming. And I think this set the bar a bit high.  Stuart and Andy did have good vibes, but it was so laser focused on sprinting/running, that there wasn’t much else for someone who doesn’t care a lot about that.  They occasionally would make as tatement about something more broad and philosophical, but that was all huberman taking tangents and stu just grounded us back into hops, skips, or jumps.  I mention skips because it was kind of silly hearing that stuart skips often on the side of the road to warm up and loosen his body.  An old man skipping lol.  But that is their point, its that a lot of movements are good and the things sprinters do are different.  Their mentality is different.  And their genes are different.  It was interesting they dared touch on white vs. black runnings, wow, but didn’t really hash that out super well and huberman kinda drove it (proud of you).  Overall, pretty ok if your into running and track and details around optimizing movement, but a bit underwhelming.
