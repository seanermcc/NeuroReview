Every podcast i've heard centered around 'emotions' is always interesting and hits hard. From Coleman Ruiz, Kay Tye, Lisa Feldman Barrett, IMmordino Yang, Karl Deisseroth---these all have a similar vibe and resounding theme: Emotion is complex, intimately linked with the brain, and it is developed. Thus, this podcast emphasizing 'emotional intelligence', and Andrew and Marc really diving right into that idea and what it means, touches on a nice aspect of emotions in that we can actually develop, think, and grow our emotional awareness. Marcc and Andrew get emtional at times throughout this one, especially towards the end, but stay somewhat mechanistic and grounded in science and literature for the majority of the discussion. This should be a must watch for anyone who feels close minded, or unclear, about their own emotions or those of peoples they love, as well as all the previous names mentioned above. The neuroscience of emotion is so interesting, so realtively understudied/small, and such a misunderstood reality of our world that more people need to try to learn to be better humans.
