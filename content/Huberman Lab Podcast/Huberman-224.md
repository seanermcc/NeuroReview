This episode was incredibly profound, especially for those of us that have been following huberman and may or may not know of JP.  As someone who has been effected by both of these men, the collab was just so great. This was so heart/soul opening for huberman, and he showed himself as extremely vulnerable here, which was awesome.

The mysteries of science and faith unite…
