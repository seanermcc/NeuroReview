##Summary
As far as journal clubs go, this is awesome. However I just feel that journal clubs generally are pretty cringe and this was impossible to get past during the conversation. While this was a lot more light hearted and fun than any other journal club ive ever ran or been a part of, something about the structure of journal clubs needs to be restructured into just conversation/learning and thus a journal club just becomes a discussion and learning opportunity, i feel i've gotten alot more out of different papres you reference and get organically excited about rather than trying to force the exctiement through a 'journal club' .
