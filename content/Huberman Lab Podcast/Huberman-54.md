Huberman really kisses up to Jack so its obvious he knows him as a mentor, but I think it was a bit too much. They talk a bit about mechanism, and then go throughout multiple papers, but I felt the big picture often got lost. It was cool to see how Jack discovered brain areas and, and a bit of the politics about his students and science were cool, but the depth and understanding of some of the ideas was lost in some of the humility. While its good to see scientists humble, it can get to be too much and I feel it was here. Huberman was too respectful and Jack was too humble, so much so he wouldn’t make definitive enough statements. But they hit breathing and meditation and relevance of mouse breathing and physological sighs well and this was all applicable and cool so not necessarily bad episode, but could have been better in my opinion.
