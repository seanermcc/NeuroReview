Huberman talks about all things sex and gross and taboo: Penis, vagina, cervix, male/female, anal sex, pornography, sex drive.  And does so in a professional and scientific way with Dr. Rena Malik.  I feel they do discuss some contentious topics well, especiall porn and Pelvic floor and erections, but when getting into masturbation it was spoken very liberal.  I feel the truth here that masterbation is somewhat wrong/bad is not talked about or even assumed and instead its made ok which is a problem with todays online society.  But besides this point most of the contentious points were talked about elegently and directly and contentiously when needed.  Not as many tools regarding what to do to help you with your issues, would have made this better.
