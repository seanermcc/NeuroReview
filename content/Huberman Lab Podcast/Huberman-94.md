This episode was a nice story of hubermans week and his workout.  For someone like me or other fans of huberman, this is great.  But in general if you are looking for a more general 'toolkit', im not sure this is exactly what it is.  I wish a bit more mechanism and connection to other podcasts/researchers would have been more included, this would have helped it feel a bit less huberman focused and egotistical.  But this episode is the kind of content that real followers of the huberman podcast want, so not necessarily upset about it.  But cant rate it much higher because of the focus on self.
