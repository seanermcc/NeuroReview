While both pain and pleasure are technically determined by neurons, and this episode gives some nice basics for how this works, its very much focused on pain.  The idea of pleasure is pushed off towards the end and not discussed as much mechanistically, besides just saying ‘dopamine’, and instead is more conceptualized and made counter to pain.  Another episode like this with experts in the field, and questions about neuroscience of pain/pleasure, which are definitely discussed in future episdoes, is warranted based on this episode.  But this was still interesting and worth listening to for a young scientist.
