This was just such a weird conversation, where andy drove it into such niche and weird and just cringy/awkward places constantly.  Harold did a fantastic job of manuvering around these awkward specific, anecdotal, and rarely scientific questions.  It felt like a kid who knows a little about food trying to impress the expert by asking him about the food he knows.  Personally, I really liked the discussion on cheese, but come on a scientific discussion on cheese?  I felt like more zooming into Harolds life and career would have been great.  But huberman tries to do this, and then takes this over and adds his own anecdotal information to it.  So annoying.  This could have been much better, but the niche topic and extremely niche and anecdotal questions from huberman and his life and his food interests made it too specific to him and hard to listen to.
