Its intersting how there are specific mechanisms and neural circuits that relate to creativity.  You would think creativity is an abstract idea, but the fact that there are known circuits allowing convergent/divergent thinking, and that this is developed over our lifetime, is fascinating. I always appreciate the way huberman describes networks and brain areas but then gives context at a higher, simpler level that grounds these mechanisms. It wouldn’t be a hub podcast without tools, and he gives a few bsic ideas that could enhance creativity, then shrooms.  This is a good segway into future creativity convos (rick r and lex),
