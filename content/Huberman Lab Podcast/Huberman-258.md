2**Video Notes--9.7.25---Great topic, good convo, somewhat drawn out questions from huberman, weird backstory at end.  







This was a very mechanistic and neuroscientific packed episode about cortisol and its cricuits.  My biggest issue is how hyped huberman gets for it in the intro, and it was really just another classic episode.  Acting like this episode is the end all be all for tools takes away from the power and impact of the dozens, if not hundred tools and ideas that have been presented elegantly throughout the podcast.  So that biased me throughout, and made it hard to listen for me.  Much of the details and ideas were hit in many other episodes, and I felt like huberman was a bit too awkward with delievering the neuroscience here and jumped into the tools too often and too directly.  Like getting so hyped and detailed about licorishe was a bit weird and unnecessary for example.  Some more overviews and generalizations would have helped this episode I think, and relating to many of the other podcasts and mentioning more names of people (besides just sapolsky and testosterone) would have been good.  Like handling stress at a high level has been talked about so much, and should have been emphasized for a good chunk of the episode.
