This podcast was very informative about a somewhat controversial topic for a drug that many people use and abuse in the street, but in the clinic it can be helpful for depression. Thus, its important for scientists to talk about and consider, which is exactly what is done throughout the podcasts. Especially at the beginning, huberman harps on plasticity and explains mechanisms underlying NMDA, LTP and LTD, and how affecting this can affect our brains. Also then easing into the studies and talking about how these are used in the clinic then makes it more relevant scientifically, and huberman dances elegantly from mechanism to papers and the street (K-hole ex) throughout this podcast. Very well done on this kind of topic.
