This was cool to listen back on.  I still remember the physiological sigh years later, and remember why I tried it and was interested because it was literally hubermans reasearch for a while.  Cool to hear him speak with the same tone and intenstiy and passion as he does with other science with his own—this is a real skill and shows an ability to hide an ego when communicating.
