This episode was super similar in message and information to hubermans solo podcast on oral health, and neither of them mentioned it at all which was kind of weird. I actually liked and preferred that solo episode to this one because it wasn’t political or sexually awkward for no reason.  Why huberman pushed politics and weird questions, no idea.  There was a bit of mechanism here, and that was ok, but nowhere near as much as the solo.  And the mechanisms for de and re/mineralization is fascinating. Staci was cool and had an ok story, but not as cool as huberman made it seem with the constant hype.  She’s just a dentist, why are we overly respecting her and the field?? We didn’t even get to hear hubermans mentin of the pillars of mental health, and how oral health should/is one of them in his mind.  Felt like this was an older Huberman episode the way it unfolded, and it would have been a little better if there wasn’t already a better podcast on the exact same podcast with more mechanistic concentration and excitement.
