Trauma is real, and its in our brains, and there are indeed things we can do about it. Paul speaks so well and jives extremely well with andy (better than with Lex).  A ton of great queestions and a ton of even better answers, often profound and no fear of diving into touch and scary topics (like suicide).  This is a great precursor to the guest series and touches on a bunch of them.  A great place to start to get to know Conti and him and andy’s friendship/relationship.
