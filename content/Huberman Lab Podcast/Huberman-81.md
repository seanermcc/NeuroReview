Honestly didn’t feel like hubermans questions were great here, and charles kept saying great question and acting like it was so good.  There wasn’t enough of a story or big picture to make this followable for the lay person--for me I was pretty interested as a neuroscientsist but indeed I had to listen to this podcast multiple times to get through it.  Didn’t hold me in my seat very well. Charles kind of interupted huberman at times and gave off a pompous vibe when talking about his discoveries and his research.  Is you learning about taste really making a big difference in the world?  You acted like it.  I didn’t see the reality of the difference.  What other labs do similar work and what giants in the field do you stand on?  Charles and AH tried to be friendly and fun and joke but this was a bit cringe at times, and I owould have liked some more serious questions about his science journey and purpose of his research and his life journey
