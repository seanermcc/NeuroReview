So many moments of this podcast really hit hard, some real gems throughout.  My favorite was the statement on bravery, which felt like it oculd be broadend to any relationship (or really anything worth doing): “If you're not scared, its not brave.'’  The part on trauma was another, and I wish Huberman would have gone more mechanistic and referenced previous podcasts (espeically Conti and the guest series).  But huberman did such a good job listening and let Sexton really go off so often, which was nice and different from many guests like this.  Felt very friendly and it let it get deep because of it.  There is some irony here where two guys who arent married (one divorced) and huberman who has been called out as a player to talk about pre-nups, which just inherently makes this worse, but the stuff around the prenups was really gold and made this a great convo to listen to.  Would recommend for anyone who is married or thinking about it.  Like Huberman said at the end, hearing someone like this who has so much wisdom when they speak (“density of wisdom for when he speaks”).  Cool to also hear and see him as a fan and friend of huberman, makes it all feel pretty real and relatable.
