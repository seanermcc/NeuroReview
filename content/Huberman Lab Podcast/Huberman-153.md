'Knowledge is power'-~20min.  Coni talks about his own experience with his brothers suicide and connects it to the general principle that someone is adressing and going through 'Self Care' Abscess analogy is great--similar to things in our brain.   Agency and gratitude (again)--are 'ways of living' are 'being' and are' Loops back to these points multiple times. A good ending to this series, but not quite the best cus it’s a bit repetative at times--feels like ive heard some of the points multiple times (especially listening to conti on Lex and Peterson).
