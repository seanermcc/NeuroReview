This podcast starts with another solid, natural conversation of getting into how you should think about your training big picture--what goals should you have?  And the point comes across clearly--you need to think longer term, what are you trying to achieve, and not necessarily be so stuck on short term or metric based goals.  This point is nailed down huge, for almost 1.5 hours, and I felt it went on much too long. Then there are a few more fun questions about exercise timing, sleeping, volume, that give us a nice break.  But then we dive into a prolongued example of a 1 year plan that takes us into a long discussion about the timing of lifting throughout the year.  And throughout this we never really have much scientific mechanism or papers referencing much of these details, as compared to last few episodes (instead its just more examples of galpins training with athletes…).    These were a bit too niched and the convo didn’t flow (wasn’t as fun to listen to frankly) as the previous podcasts in this guest series.  So while this episode wasn’t necessarily bad, it was just worse relative to all previous episodes.
