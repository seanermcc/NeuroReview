'Fructose has a red flag if it had a tinder profile--it supressess hunger supressing hormones (can increase hunger'.  A classic huberman joke, funny and cringe I love.  This pod gives a foundation for a lot of future topics and conversations, especailly along the ideas of taste, food, fasting, workingout, gut microbiome, gut neurons.  If you find this interesting in other podcasts, this is the one to go back to to get solid mechanism and basics regarding how sugar effects your body.  That’s the first half at least (pretty science heavy).  Then some nice (and classic) huberman tools (omega3 for example), and others (lemon juice). Hear (maybe for first time?) about hub love for kettle chips.  He speaks very clearly about fruit and sugar and mechanisms and is an overall good episode, especially for learning.
