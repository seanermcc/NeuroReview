This convo has great flow, style, and some great questions from huberman to get some awesome emotion and feeling out of Casey.  This is often missed with some of the MDs that come on and the convos are too technical and hyper focused.  The end where casey was really made a person and talked about his struggles and how he does his job and what he does to get through things, was really profound.  The story of casey came out and it was exciting and it put some context on the science and medicine that was talked about for 1.5 hours before.  Not necessarily a lot of mechanism in this episode, but good details about the interworkings of neurosurgery and principles about them that allow Casey to potentially treat binging disorders and OCD.  More detail could have been nice, like how exactly does the stimulation alter the eating behavior mechanistically.  But otherwise a really good conversation and worth the listen for anyone.
