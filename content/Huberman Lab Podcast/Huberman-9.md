These old episodes are great in the basic neuroscience intro that is always given.  Great for anyone who isnt an expert.  Love the topic of ‘plasticity of perception’ as its super actionable and something if you havnt thought about explicitly, when you do it can really change your life. It got a bit all over the place after some of the basic neuroscience was explained, and I felt plasticity was not emphasized enough.  Instead it was more leaning towards the actionaable tools aspect of HL pod, but it wasn’t super actionable and was more of a hodgepodge of things that are painful and the facts if they do or don’t change your brain.  Could have been more mechanistic and nuanced. Was ok, but not great, and was a bit short and all over the place.
