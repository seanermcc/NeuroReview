Im not sure an entire episode to recovery was necessary--seemed like a lot of time was spent in this convo thinking about how you might want to recover, and it felt like it was still targeted for major atheletes and high performance people.  The tools didn’t feel as normal and natural as the first 3 episodes, and there wasn’t a nice flow of science around a lot of the tools as well.  Still was a fun convo, with huberman asking some good questions and andy once again not missing a beat even for a second.  But just not near as good as the last 4 episodes.  The acute overload portion and breathing in order to actually gain strength and muscle was good and a golden nugget in a silver platter of an episode.
