looking back on this episdoe, this is such a 'Classic Huberman'. The shoutout to craig heller, especially now that I know him from future stuff, is so great and this may be the start where you talk of him (I think). The face/palm/feet mechanisms has come through in multiple other episodes and here it reallllly comes through great, with all the mechanistic insight wow. So cool. Some other mechanisms about heat maybe or temperature generally would be nice here, you can def do something like this for longer in future (i think you do!)
