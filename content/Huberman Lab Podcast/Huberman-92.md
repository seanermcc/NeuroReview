This is a nice deep dive into marijuana from the basics of its science and also its useage, although from a scientist who’s clearly never done it.  But there were definitely a bit of issues when it came to some of the statements and especially the 20 minutes that was called out by Mathew hill on twitter and eventually led to him coming on the podcast later.  But still I felt like some of the energy that was there in the alcohol episode that just wasn’t quite there, as I guess it didn’t feel as relatable and well studied.   Glad there was another later, and possibly this kind of stuff should get mentioned in other episodes and brought up to experts studying drugs and neuromodulators.
