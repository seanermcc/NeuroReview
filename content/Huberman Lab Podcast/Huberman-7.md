This is a foundational podcast for many of the future podcasts and ideas that are touched on during the Huberman Podcast.  The foundation of neuroplasticity and error based learning is mechanistically explained in the perfect amount of detail here. Other pods get into more mechanism of LTP and LTD, but this does it in a very easy to follow, actionable, and exciting way.  Huberman even reiterates the idea multiple times, reminding us of the neurotransmitters that are important for this (Acetylcholine, epinepherine, and dopamine). The little intro to dopamine is a nice enticing idea touched on here thtat is hashed out a ton later.  But remembering this idea of neurpolasticity being triggered by errors in those later episodes in fundamental.  A key part of neurosience that I had learned a few times before lisiting to this pod, but after listening I KNEW it.  And I started seeing this in people, realizing where I am and am not learning based on errors, and started to see failure and negativity as truly helping me learn and grow.  Its not just some crap a crazy high school teacher of coach said.  Its hard (and soft) wired neuroscience.
