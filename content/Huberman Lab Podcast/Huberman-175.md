This is an outlier huberman podcast, as it is concise and to the point.  I kind of enjoyed this style for a niche podcast like this--when these are 2+ hours it can be a bit too much.  A nice reiteration of a handful of other podcasts (Lembke and Ali Krumb) who talk a bit about mindset and belief, and with some nice mentioning of a handful of studies.  There was a little mechanism throughout, but not really necessary to just reiterate the point that placebo, which is just believing something will happen, actually causes physiological and neurological changes to happen.  This idea kind of blows my mind, and having an entire podcast where that is just stated a dozen or so times, as it is here, was really nice and well done.  A good niche podcast!
