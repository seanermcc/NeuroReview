Pavel was a well spoken, humble, and cool guy who knew his stuff.  He went into a ton of detail on specifics and mechanisms of strength and flexibility and breathing. This was on par and up there with galpin podcasts, with a simlar style but a different (russian) culture, instead of being a bit nerdy/white/american like galpin. There was a nice balance of story with mechanism, where the story was often russian related lifting ideas, so it stayed on theme. This is a great place for someone to start of continue their fitness podcast journey and necessary for anyone interested in the intersection of science and lifting/training.
