The topics here are classic huberman stuff, and indeed they are discussed in a decent way. Except they were mainly discussed by Andrew, and not by Terry.  A top comment early on was that huberman was not letting his speak like he normally did, and after seeing this I couldn’t help but agree and get annoyed that andrew interuppted and added his own thing so often.  Then terry just keeps saying how all these questions are so good, but it’s a bit like overusing the word epic.  Every questions cant be a ‘great’ question, and huberman takes so long to ask them its just objectively not great.  More terry and less huberman would have made this a great podcast that’s easier to listen to.  Especially sinc ehuberman has so many solo learning and productivity podcasts, reference us back to those instead of talking about the points for 1-3 mins.
