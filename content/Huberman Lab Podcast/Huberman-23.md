Huberman specifically tells us that he is going to discuss mechanism and then practical impact throughout the episdoe, and this is indeed what happens.  I like this style as it switches up some of the previous and many other episodes that load mechanism at the beginning.  Instead it felt a bit more storylike and had a connected line throughout, and it ended up feeling like a conversation instead of a lecture.  The basic reminder about energy and ATP and the connection to muscles and brain and then endurance felt really natural, and this was another classic episode that is a good precursor to the Galpin series and other future exercise episodes.
