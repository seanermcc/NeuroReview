Huberman is always great at talking about sex and women and relationships with a objective lens, and indeed they do here. But with all of that said a big picture summary explaining how everything talked about here is rooted in biological sex differences would have been nice. It was basically 2 hours of how women are different than men without ever pointin it out. But indeed, many of this felt obvious and simple but neat to be put in a scientific lens with data.
