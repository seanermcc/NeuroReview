Huberman and Karen go into the depths of autism through a number of studies that dive into the nuance of oxytocin/vasopressin, social intearaction and how these relate to autism. And they often find themselves in areas that are still open questions and need more studies.  It seems that the tools and things they have to 'help' atuism arnet very helpful and don’t necessarily address the mechanisms that are discussed.
