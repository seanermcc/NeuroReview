A TON of talk on ApoB and cholesterol at the beginning, which if you care about that its super relevant. But then they get into brain and neurodegen and the accidental death and things get a bit more emotional, until huberman brings up emotional health and part of that in the book.  They spend a solid 30+ mins about Peters emotional helath journey and what it meant and damn it was powerful.  Seeing someone be vulnerable and weak even though we look at him as a strong bro scientist is why these podcasts are great.  It was just rough that it took 3 hours (plus a previous 3 in the other podcast) for me to get to this point with Peter.  But hey, that’s the beauty in the beast of these podcasts and long form convo--we get to know these guys as real (and legit) scientists and forget they are humans, but after 5+ hours you get to see the real humanity in Peter.
