This was weird--I was upset they never really addressed the big elephant in the room, which is giving kids ADHD drugs.  And another weird part was huberman giving props to John for making connections between guy microbiome and ADHD and he just shrugged it off and went next.  Felt like there was a disconnect between the two, and they just kind of went through drugs and some behaviors and how they affect ADHD.  Not bad, but not particularly interesting/good.
