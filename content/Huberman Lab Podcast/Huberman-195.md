This was a convo with a lot of things that need to be said about phones and seem to be obvious but are not necessarily as simple as they sound.  They demonize (and rightfully so) smart phones for childern throughout the podcast, and while this is important and they do so with great neurobiological backing (thanks hub), they don’t do justice to the postivie and reasoning why they are a thing I feel.  The 4 tools to help with kids were great (1) no smartphone til HS, no social media til 16, phone free schools, and more independence free play).  This sounds great but it also sounds utopian.  I love the humility of Jon where yes he has a book and talks about it some but asks huberman for help about explainin more of brain and neuro basics that underly it and was genuinely curious.  Let huberman talk/say his peace.  Talk about porn was a bit striking but also so true and relevant and helpful.  They do a nice dance about male/female differences that might make people mad but his voice and attitute is soft and well meaning.   Overall a great podcast and must listen.   For me personally I felt super related to this given that I was growing up right when smart phones came out (I remember ipod touch in middle school vividly--I listened to all of my music).  I do feel there is some good in this whole thing and while the bad is obvious and I was sucked in (porn and social media and vidoes) the podcast culture and music avaliablity arnet necessarily totally negative for kids and thus this conversation I feel deserves stronger pushback and more discussion (maybe have lex on to chat more about it lol).
