Tom and huberman do ok throughout this conversation, although it was a bit short and a little cutoff at times.  But andy was a bit too much and takes over at other times, and this took away from tom as a person and made it more about andy and science, which felt forced.  The constant ‘scientific’ spin (if you even want to call it that, often made it feel like it was just overthinking comedy and psychology, and this kind of took the humor away from the comedy of this episode itself, which was there at times.  Im somewhat biased here because I like Tom a lot, but felt this could have been way way better with more stories from tom and his life and how he got where he was---this was all missed and glossed over at times. Huberman would basically bring it up and then ask a tangential question, instead of letting tom share his info.  Tom managed to keep it funny at times and have some good jokes, which was refreshing and frankly saved the podcast, but Andy was a bit too much.  Was cool to see tom have some insights based on questions and observations Huberman made, but you kind of like to see the opposite.  There was some nice rope backs to joe rogan and rick Rubin, and overall an ok episode, but it really could have been great.
