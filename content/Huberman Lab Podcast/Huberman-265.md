# Review
Konstantina was really awesome--a classic scientist who clearly knows her stuff.  But what she did have that many others dont is a compelling and excitable personality (although she doesnt necessarily give off the vibe initially) that makes for a great conversation. She was similar to andy in her knowledge of the auditory system and how she explained it, with a nice big picture context to much of her detail.  This created a nice back and forth that made for a great convo.  Not much backstory---but it wasn't needed based on the flow and style of the convo.
