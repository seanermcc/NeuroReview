So as a scientist who has followed huberman as both a scientist and a podcaster, there are some issues to bring up here.  Scientists that knew huberman before his online presence now say that his podcast and online prescence "Just sells supplements", and the way that this podcast goes so well with AG1 and momentous (supplement sponsors) just emphasize this.  I wish huberman would have addressed this point in this podcast.  But something these scientsists don’t hear (since the ones that say this don’t really listen to the HLP) is that huberman really does emphasize that supplements should NOT be the first thing people use, and getting proper sleep and nutrition and exercise are much more helpful.  I do like how this episode goes through many of these supplements and references other previous podcasts and future ones (Galpin) for more details.  So if you are interested in supplements, this podcast is a great one.  But for me, someone who doesn’t use any supplements, this was a bit hard for me to get through.  I rated it based on the flow and content, and it was decent, and I appreciate the constant disclaimer about the behavioral and nutrition factors.  There wasn’t much neuronal mechanism here that I would have liked more at times, but you can find those in the specific referenced podcasts.
