(22mins, good point here).  Psychopathology is expression of suffering of the soul--language roots. Lots of hype built into this pdc, and indeed it was pretty good. But I do think the hype lesened the umph and impact of it--why mention you had to travel?  Who cares?  Touched elegantly on self, soul, purpose, drive, dpression, and even male/female diffeerences without being cliché or annoying.
