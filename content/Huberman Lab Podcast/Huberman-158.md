This was a really fundamental episode that does a great job of referencing many of the great past episodes, primarily Lisa Barrett (156) and Conti and his series.  The 6 pillars of health come up in other episodes too, but here is where its really spelled out (I’ve wondered where it was in detail).  This is something ive taken with me and thought about, espeically when becoming a parent, that has really helped me in different ways.  Focusing on sleep (and using light/caffeine/breathing to help optomize it), reducing stress and handling it, breathing/meditating/praying, eating well, excercising—these have all been core to how my wife and I raise our kids.  And it has felt like common sense, but a lot of it isnt.  For example, an early morning walk.  Trying to make real food for your infant (keeping away cookies, ect), oh and also socialness.  This has helped our 1yo thrive so far.  And its interesting how as a parent we seem to care more about their and others mental health then our own.  I will  focus more on my onwn in the future after re-listening to this.
