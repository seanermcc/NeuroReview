This was a really nice conversation around neural mechanisms (higher level) of grief and attachment.  This whole space and time idea in our brain hits a chord, and also makes me think of the dopamine episode(s) on time sensing. Its neat to think that overlapping mechanisms cause us to feel these large and hard feelings, and the idea that these are neuronal and can (and will) be changed is a great way for someone who is science minded and interoceptive to handle these feelings. The idea of neuroplasticity for this as well is powerful. I liked the tools as they weren't too dominant, but made sense and were literature backed. The fact this is paired right before conti is also great—relistened to that one at the same time, would recommend them together.
