This podcast teaches us clearly about interoception and exteroception, two concepts that unless you really think about we just generally take for granted our entire lives. This helps me to think about meditating and how the mind works, and how the attentional and focus aspects of our mind are so key to everything. Deliberate thinking is so key, and this comes through in this episode.  The tools seemed a bit like a list to me, and werent necessarily connected back to mechanism, and the way you shout out your own papers doesn’t feel too humble. But the joke about what mathew walker would come at us with--an alarm clock and pillow, was GOLD, had me dying.  Pretty classic intro to meditiation, and a good start for you to then have sam harriss on later and actually get into meditation in your own time.
