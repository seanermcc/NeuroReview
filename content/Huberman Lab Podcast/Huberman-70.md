While good, this podcast was very supplemental focused.  The tools and storeies and personal insights here are great, and Rhonda and Andrew have really good chemistry throughout. But more talk on science, culture, and being a podcaster/science communicator would have been really valuable and insightful. Both are very unique individuals and bond on a number of thigs regarding supplementation and personal life, but never discuss the elephant in the room that you are both successful scientific social media influencers. This should have been a topic discussed instead of so many details on numbers and supplements.
