You start off with a very interesting phenomena about a brain area that is basically agression (VTA of hypo), and these studies are intersting and fastinating. I think you could have talked about this much  more. The mechanisms with hormones, neuromodulators, and neurohormones is neat and how these work to modulate agression and then the end message bing that agression is complicated and controlled by a lot of things made me think of it as an emotion (think LFB and Mary IY).  But then this isnt tied back to the first 30 min chunk about BTA and I feel like a more overaching theme and story could have been pulled out of this (maybe with some of your personal stories?)
