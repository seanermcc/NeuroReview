Love the way you are able to talk about this stuff, and theres a lot of real problems people are facing in fertility, sex and parenting. Hwoever, this was a very niche podcast, and it felt like at times it was focused on people going through in-vitro, which is a very small population of, lets face it, rich people.  Going back to the science and fundamentals more here, especially neuroscience, would have been more beneficial imo.
