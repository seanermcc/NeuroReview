Chris was a super cool dude, and andy did a great job trying to match his energy.  But the ‘f around and find out’ statement that andy brought up cought on, and it felt a bit non scientific and unprofessional relative to the usual huberman style.  Which is sometimes ok, but when talking about a potentially contentious topic that has questionable legality, I think more professional and scientific is generally better. While this episode sometimes felt mechanistic and like it was going to get there, it didn’t really go too much into it except for the 1 alkaline metabolite that they dicuss which has 3 MOAs.  It was unclear to me if that was all kratom, or if it was other things too.  The chemistry got too chemical and not enough neuroscientific for the episode and most listeners.  Like what about some of the brain circuits that are most effected?  What about dopamine?  Would have liked some more interruptions with mechanism from Huberman here.
