A really good and classic huberman episode, especially given his love of Yerba Mate. The 4 mechanisms for caffeine are very interesting and make a lot of sense, really pretty simple. Then explaining how in nature plants with caffeine improve animals 'mood' and 'feeling' and thus make them more attractive stamps this home even more. Basically the fact that we as a species are attracted to caffeine is neuronal across any species, down to even bee's, and the science and underlying the positive effects of caffeine are so strong and overwhelming. However, huberman is rightfully cautious and doesn't just recommended you go crazy, and instead discusses a lot of ways to abstain from caffeine to achieve a stronger effect later, and to not try to get dependent on it. Huberman does a great job not making too many strong claims based on the data and does a nice dance of mechanism and tools here that make this a classic and high quality solo episode.
