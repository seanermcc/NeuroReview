This conversation was somewhat classic at this point for Huberman talking about sex, fertility, and just not being afraid to discuss these kinds of taboo topics. I couldn’t help but be amused/uncomfortbale at the same time about the discussion of the distance between genitles and anus (it’s the taint, why is that a bad word) that they talked about for like a whole hour. Kind of interesting I guess that this is different now adays for many reasons, but still a little too much discussion on this.  This whole convo also felt a bit negative—like a classic old person saying ‘all the new stuff is terrible and killing everyone’ even while health and longevitity is constantly increased in todays society.  Felt a bit like fear mongering at times with plastic as a negative, food, lifestyle ect. Would have liked some more pushback from Huberman and desire to dive into the data more nuanced and discuss the big picture interpretations without so much decisiveness.
