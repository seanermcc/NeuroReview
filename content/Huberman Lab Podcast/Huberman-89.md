pod_notes: 'Great insights into aggression and mating and mechanisms underlying them.  Love
  the idea of ''switches'' in the brain, where we can activate certain areas and incducing
  anger or mating or fear. Plus how close they are in the brain is just fascinating.
  The personal connection with david is also great.  Huberman is great at talking
  about mating and sex (''consentual, age, species appropriate always cracks me up)
  and it makes this info more fun and easier to digest and get something out of.  '
