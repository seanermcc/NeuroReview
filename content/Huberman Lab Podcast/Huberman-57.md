As I am biased towards vision and visual neuroscience, I wanted to rate this higher.  But I fell like it was SO focused on vision that the title was misleading, and that other more general things about work (for example your own work habits that you do talk about but not as much in this episode) would have been great. You mention 'the literature' a number of times but then dont dive into mechanism, and i think you could have even if it is redundent with other podcasts in the past (or future!).
