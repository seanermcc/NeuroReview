Huberman and Craig discuss many peptides, with a lot of info on dosing and effects and discussion on their efficacy and approval.  But this is really it.  Hardley any mechanism, neuroscience, or 'fun' detial regarding how these work.  Felt this kind of episode feeds right into a common critism of the pod where huberman 'just sells supplements'.  Would have liked much more nuance, more stories, and more relation to previous guests and epiosdes (although did a little with deisseroth and attia).  Felt this was redundent with a lot of previous pods and not really good for a general audience, only good for aficionado supplement users.
