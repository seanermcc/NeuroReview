There were many gems throughout this pod, especially to someone who likes teaching/mentoring/podcasting/lecturing/speaking.  But It was very cringe at many times as well with some of Adam's jokes and overhype of Huberman and himself, somewhat non-humble at times. Also Andrew definitely overhyped him and it fell too buddy buddy, not necessarily professional enough.   Talks about asi wind a lot, and that pod was NOT GREAT lol.  And they get overhyped about collaborations and how great/amazing the things adam is saying are--some of it seemed straightforward.  But the becky kennedy hype about parenting is definitely great, so cool to reference other scientists (something adam says he is good at and is a humble thing).  Overall a lot of great things and a lot of cringe and tough to listen to things, so rating could have been either way, felt MID based on everything.
