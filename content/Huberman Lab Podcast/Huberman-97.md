I think the content and questions and infromation that Layne talks about is great.  His youtube channel is cool, and he definitely practices what he 'preaches', is humble, and admittingly a good scinetist in that he has an open mind and is willing to change his thoughts and practices depenidng on more science.  However He talked a bit fast at many times, at the end they sold their carbon app, and there wasn’t much of a narrative to follow throughout.  Instead it was more of a hodgeppodge on different taboo things around working out and losing wait and eating and thus not one of my favorites. Felt like many of these topics have entire huberman episodes on them and other convos in this space, for example Peter Attia, Andy Galpain (and guest series) Elissa Epel are a little better and more fun to listen to.  Definitely a bro out version of the huberman lab, and if you are really into nutrition/working out this would be a good one to listen to.  But if not not sure its necessray and its long, so maybe 2x speed it.
