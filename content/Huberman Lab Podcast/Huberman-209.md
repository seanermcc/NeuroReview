Huberman and Esther dive into the nuances of relationships, especially conflict and resolution and the nature of our charcter and apologies.  However the fact that huberman has issues in this space is pretty much universally known at this point, and its totally ignored here, casting a small shadow over this episode.  The episode standing alone is really good--ester is a great, passionate speaker who uses her personal and stories as a psychotherapist to tell big picture themes and ideas.  But huberman makes some neuroscience connections and never brings up his own situation, which I felt needed to be done for this to hit as hard as it could have.  Was good info, especially for people in long term and committeed relationships--espeically the parts about growing together or apart (hit home for me personally), but I couldn’t get over the lack of speaking about the elephant in the room of hubermans relationship issues.
