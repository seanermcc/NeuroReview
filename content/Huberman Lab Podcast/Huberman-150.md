This was a really interesting and necessary topic---the beauty of the fact that our neurons literally play music in our brains can not be stated enough.  It really highlights why music plays such a critical role in our emotions and brains generally.  However, your personal love of music and experiences, which i've heard you speak about in different podcasts, dont come across very well and it makes me want to ask you more personal and relatable questions about how music has shaped and affected huberman, not just how it generally affects people.
