This is better than the last journal club--the vibe and the way that they arent afraid to take discussions away from the journal to make them more relevant is really nice. There was alos some nice editing that allowed for us to see the figures you were discussing which is helpful.  Maybe mentioning which journals you will use for future ones at end of this would be nice for listeners, so we can read prior to listening?
