Huberman was a bit all over the place with this one, and called out a lot of different knid of somewhat controversial or strange ideas here—psychadelics, keto diets, fasting, background music.  While there was some solid mechanism, especially at the beginning, it got a bit all over the place and a lot of personal stories and ideas about hubermans life, which at the time and even now is a bit unnecessary.  Mechanistic parts were ok, but it came across a bit egotistical and random throughout.  I will say since ive listened to 200+ now episodes in the future, these topics do get touched on specifically with many many experts, but presented in this way is a bit too all over the place and egotistical to be a good episode.
