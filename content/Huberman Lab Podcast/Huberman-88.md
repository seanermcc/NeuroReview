This kind of solo podcast is a staple of the huberman lab podcast--learn mechanism and then learn tools that address this mechanism.  From adreneline with cold showers/stress, to acetylecholine with meditation and NSDR, or to dopamine and omega 3 fatty acids, these themes come up throughout the HL pod all over, and are set up here elegantly with brief mechanism and application of how/why to use them.  Once again Hub talks behaviors and sleep and emphasizes this before supplements, and gives us an actionable short (relatively) 'lecture' on how to improve our focus (and what our focus is).  Classic huberman solo pod.
