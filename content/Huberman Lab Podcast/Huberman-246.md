This is a nice supplemental to the conti series that is super focused on death and grief after a loss.  And this is likely going to relate with most everyone, and maybe not what you would want to hear right after someone is gone but if you are trying to get over it its perfect.  The fact that the attachment mechanisms are so engrained in our minds, is fascinating and makes it really make sense how badly it can hurt to lose someone.  We actually cant rationalize to our subcontious that they are gone, and this isnt crazy or wrong, its completely human.  This point was constantly reiterated, and is a really cool part of our brains.  The stories and chatter was nice, but something was a bit off about mary that made her not so compelling/inspiring.  Maybe she’s too good of a scientist.  But this is a good pod for someone science minded wanting to get over or understand grief/loss, and good if you really liked conti.
