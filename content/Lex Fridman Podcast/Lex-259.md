Thomas is such a cool, normal dude, who’s also a billionaire. It seems that his path and plan was to just push his good ideas forward and take opportunities that come.  The podcast felt a bit shallow throughout, like many of the things they touched on had so many more interesting details and stories attached than what were shared.  Was also somewhat all over the place.  But then again, that’s Thomas’ life. Some really cool stuff about rolling stones and movies, but I don’t feel like this podcast hit as hard as it could have for some reason.  Thomas was almost too...normal? Tough for him to have a big impact on the pod because of it. Lex was cool with him and they bonded over different things. Overall it was pretty good, but not quite great.  For some reason, I was turned off clicking on this one—weird thumbnail/title I think?
