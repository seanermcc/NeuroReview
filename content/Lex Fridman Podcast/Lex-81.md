Anca was cute, and is a nice personality to have in the robotics space.  The conversation was interesting and fun and often philosophical.  The background of her love for Walley, her wedding, and then diving into personal robotics and her interest was a beatiful flow.  Its neat to see someone like this who lets their work and pasison flow into their daily lives and this is shown elegently, and very humbly, in this conversation.  I like when this kind of thing is not forced.  They could have gone into even more technical detail that would have been nice for the experts, but I liked the level of this discussion for a beginner/novice.  Not the best pod for a pro, but good for somone who has a very basic interest and excitement about robotics.
