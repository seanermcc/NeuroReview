This was a pretty good episode and neat to hear more discussion on the robotics side of things. I enjoyed some of the theoretical discussion around robotics in general and he also provides a lot of good general technology business advice. I would be curious to know how some of his perspectives have changed in the post-GPT 3 era after he showed some skepticism of the capabilities of AI (as far as matching human-level intelligence) in our lifetime.
