Gets better at back end, but indeed lex has some bad questions throughout, especially to start (lex even SAYS THIS at the end of the episode, lol). Convo felt very choppy and enviornment was off-was it at Matt's house? A bit awkard and cringe early on--then at some point ppl are walking around in background. But later when they start getting into psychology/AI and deep networks (and what that is like in the brain)--lex starts to ask better questions and listens more and we get more of Matt.
