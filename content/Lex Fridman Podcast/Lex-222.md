Really cool to see the cognitive science roots of neural networks—Thesearch for intelligence and mind and thought (nice descarts ref and background). There is a great blend of ideas and modern situations with stoires and history of concepts that lex does a great job of naviating, and jay’s life and passion and story is just so organically interesting. This is a top neural networks podcast, especially for an outsider of the field, as it was rarely too technical and instead more philosophical and fun.
