This episode was a bit weird, mainly because of how in awe and complementative Lex was of Zev.  Something about someone who is more experienced and qualified (Lex in this situation) telling someone how great and amazing everything they do is starts to be cringe and awkward and somewhat ingenuine (even though I know lex was genuine). Plus lex fed into this with some weird questions like ‘what advice do you have for young people’ and ‘why are you so scared of posting and the future’ and whatnot.  So this whole episode has this caveat.  But indeed I agree with lex that zev is really mature and says a lot of profound statements, and is exceptionally and excitingly open minded and curious and thoughtful.  But lex led this bad, and made it hard to listen (which is why I had to listen to it 3x to get through and remember).
