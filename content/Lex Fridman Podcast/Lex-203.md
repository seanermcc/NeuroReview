Someone had a great YT comment here--Lex walking down the farm in a suit is a hitman mission, or even just a video game 3rd person.  Also--is this one of hubermans 'girlfriends'?  From her vibe, and Lex bringing him up as a mutal friend, makes sense and would be super funny/interesting.  Would love to hear that part of her life if so.  This podcast was pretty much 100% focused on food, and then 'regenerative farming'.  Lex gave a nice sappy intro about animal life but they never really get into that kind of emotional talk/vibe.  But honestly felt like they didn’t talk that deeply about the whole farming idea, and overall this podcast was a bit short.  I wish some more of her story would have came out, and maybe this was on her.  Like how/why did she actually do all of this stuff.  What is the mission/purpose of her, and of the company.  This didn’t come through very strongly, so just felt like some bigger picture questions from lex may have been missing.
