It was fun as a Lex fan to see lex get romantic over skyrim and Todd, but it got a bit too much at times.  Felt like I needed to yell ‘get a room’ for how much Lex was hyping him up.  The assumption that video games are good was made entirely throughout, and this kind of assumption isnt always made by lex so it created a clear bias towards the positives of video games.  I would have liked to see some pushback and questions regarding the negatives.  What about kids and young kids getting sucked into this stuff?  Are you making it for them?  There was a lot of great convos that got deep and interesting and passionate here, which was cool and neat to hear from the perspective of the guy whose made a bunch of games we all know.  Hearing the ins and outs of how that worked and choosing a system and being bought out (70billion, Holy SHIT), was all super neat.
