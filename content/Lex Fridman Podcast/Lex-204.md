I had to relisten to this podcast 3x in order to get anything out of it.  For some reason it just continued to feel over my head and hard for me to follow unitl the final 30 mins when lex asks more classic questios about meaning of life, his mentors, and nobel prize for string theory and what not.  But there was a giant chunk about visual intuition that I had a really tough time following for some reason.  For someone really interestd in math and physics this is probably gold, but otherwise not sure its worth the listen, at least maybe listen at 2x speed until the end.
