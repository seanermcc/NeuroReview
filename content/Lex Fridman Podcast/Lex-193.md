Lex and Rob jump right into viruses and covid, and talk about it in an objective and scientific way which was much needed and good at the time.  And then they take a nice lex-like twist into evil/good, space, conciousness, fasting, and rob’s podcast. Honestly at the beginning I thought rob was a scientist, but then he was ‘just’ an author/podcaster.  I think these kinds of convos are great for scientists to hear becases this is the kind/style of communication they should all know how to do—thoguhtful, objective, and open minded, while also being convicted and confident.  Rob was a good speaker, and this was a good convo that went a bit all over the place.
