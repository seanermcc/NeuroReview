This is a very fun/friendly conversation with someone who has a similar desire to understand, see, and know ukraine like lex.  So the beginiing there is really strong/interesting on that point.  Good job from the editing guy of the pod to add a lot of good images of Craigs journey through ukraine.  Then they get into the CJI idea, and the fun and intensity of some of the ideas.  The funny collab with the big jui jitsu woman with the bet was great.  I liked the less intense talk about fighting and jiu jitsu, and instead focus on bigger picture ideas/chat. Overall this is one of my favorite 'fighting' convos, and would have liked it even longer.
