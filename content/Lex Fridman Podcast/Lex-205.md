Damn this guy runs a SHIT TON.  100 miles on a treadmill?  At a 6:30 pace?  The human body is insane.  And the humility he has when talking about it too, just so cool.  Lex gets into the psychology of this guy pretty well, but I thouhgt they could have harped more on it at times and done some zooming outside of running into life.  This whole pod was just so so running focused that it felt closed off to anyone who doesn’t like to run.  And lex just kept going down the ultramarathon/long running rabbit hole.  If you’re into running, this podcast is for you.  If not, maybe listen to the first 30-60 mins, which has some better nuggets of human psychology in it, especially in there discussion about quitting, and the rest on 2x.
