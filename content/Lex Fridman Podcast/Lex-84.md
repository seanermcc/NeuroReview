## Summary
So kind of weird that this got taken off of youtube, i dont completely understand why.  But was able to check this out through internet archives (https://archive.org/details/Will-MacAskil-Lex-Fridman).  Didnt feel like anything too crazy or controversial was in here, but whatever.  MacAskill was well spoken, and did good with Lex's overly deep and romantisized questions, especially about suffering.  Did a nice pushback on Rand, and discussion on politics.  But the length and lack of background on Williams life and story really took away from the power, and kind of made him feel like a kid and not that impactful.  And then lex at the end is like 'its a huge honor you are amazing'.  Noone knows this guy, and you didnt hardly tell us or get anything out of him about who he was.  Treating a not big philosopher like a big time philosopher makes for a not great and not super memorable conversation.
