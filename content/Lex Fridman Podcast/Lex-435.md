This was another good, friendly, and interesting side of Lex/Huberman that is very classic between them.  But the title and timing of this made me think and sure that they would talk about the recent shade huberman got with his relationships, and they didn’t!  So that was a bummer.  I know he talked about it on Jocko so not sure why they didn’t, I think this is on Lex.  I think its important to discuss the real issues and istead they kind of touch on politics, getting married, and just regular BS instead of the real BS we wanted.  I liked the beginning question from lex and answer from huberman--would you ever stop podcasting and he says yes.  Then discusses mentoring and the next generation.  This is a great scienctific mindset that is honorable andhard for someone to have when they are in the spotlight I feel.  So neat to hear from him like this.  But still, misleading and not the most intense/fun/cool convo between lex/huberman (although I still love it ☺️)
