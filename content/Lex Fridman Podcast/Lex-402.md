This is a really fun and nice break from the majority of deep/serious lex convos (especially lately). This I think is a bit short, but also a bit too fun. A few times you guys got deep and went back and forth from fun to serious, and I really liked these moments, but I think sometimes it was a bit too casual. But then again, this is really who you guys are and obviuosly genuine stuff, so while i did rate it somewhat low, i still really really liked this episode.
