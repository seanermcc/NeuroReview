The respect and chivalry between the two during this entire 'debate' (which I would rather just call a conversation) is fantastic. They go across the entire spectrum of ideas and thought and find a lot of agreeing points throughout, which is great for two people who are seemingly so far right/left in their party and views.  I feel any/all debates should bet this kind of conversational style, as it really allows for each person to exhibit their humanity and listening skills and not just their ability to speak. Lex should moderate more contentious debates like this, and from the ones I remember this is by far the best to this date.
