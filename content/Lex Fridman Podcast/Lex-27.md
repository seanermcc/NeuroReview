This was one of the better early Lex podcasts, with a really badass and cool guest. Kai-Fu reminds me of a tony stark/zuckerburg type vibe but chinese.  He definitely knows his stuff about business and AI and technology, and this is obvious throughout, but the coolest part is later on when he talks about his cancer.  And how all of the crazy amounts of work he did (9 to 9, 6 days a week--seems like a lot of 'successful' people work this much), was not the most important thing in his life.  The people and his family were.  This is important to hear from people like this, as many of us are seeming to strive for this kind of success and missing the blessings and amazing life we have at home and with our families/friends.  A longer convo would be amazing, and having him on again would also be amazin given the blow up of lex.
