Lex does a great job questioning and pushing back in his lex way on romans huge pessimism of AI.  Lex has historically done a good job not just with people like this, but with anyone who is controversial or seems to be different then he is.  Lex asks great questions, gives good points, and pushes back at the right time with most of Romans negative ideas on AI and the future and humanity.  This convo felt very natural, and to me is a great example of how anyone should speak with or against someone they disagree with; long dialouge and nuance and giving the other person the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe they are correct, maybe we are in a simulation, maybe AI will kill us.  Why? How?  What does that look like?  These though experiments are elegantly discussed and I felt that this convo is a great example of how our culuture should discuss this kind of issue (or any issue) where one may have differences of opinions.
