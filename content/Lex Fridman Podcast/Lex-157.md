Really cool to see such a delicate looking woman talk about such hardcore, badass science as rocket propulsion. Just shows you that initial appearances aren't everything. Natalys knows her stuff on rockets, and pretty cool that we learn later she started her own rocket company.  But overally this convo was a bit short and somewhat shallow compared to many other space type convos lex has.  I think it would be great to have Natalya on again to get a little more philosophical and future of rockettering.
