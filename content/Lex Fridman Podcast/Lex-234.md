This converstaion was highly technical, but at the same time often profound and impactful and cross-disciplinary.  It felt that Stephen just continuously riffed about the power and beauty of math and complexity ranging from the biggest questions in the universe to the smallest questions in biology. There was a beuatiful thread of thought and spark that was tangible troughout this convo that wasn’t there in the other wolfram episodes that really made this one stand out.  When I first watched it I rated it a 9.6, but now that ive seen a lot of lex and relistented it was a bit too much at times and I cant help but also feel steves ego that ive seen more in other pods, but it was still great.  The best SW episode by far.
