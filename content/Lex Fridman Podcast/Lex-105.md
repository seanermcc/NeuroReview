This was a decent convo with a big time researcher, and lex lets us know (and Robert know) how big time he is: ‘You have a billion citations, you have 100+ ppl in your lab’, ok lex quit being so startstruck and have a real convo.  This was ok, but it felt a bit too big picture and idealistic.  Would have liked some more nuance and insight into the details of some of Roberts ideas instead of just overview type questions from lex.  Robert would be GREAT TO HAVE ON AGAIN now that lex is much bigger and better, and hopefully for longer.
