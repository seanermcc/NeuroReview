This conversation really brings biology and hard basic science 'to life'.  Hearing a scientist talk so freely and sincerely about free will, agency, and then rooting it all in biology is incredibly refreshing.  The idea that we can study these 'simple' organisms, weather it’s the worm that lives forever (incredibly fascinating) or frog embryos, and find so much that suprises us and that is novel scientifically, tells me just how little we know about biology in general.  This is a top podcast for Lex as it shows the beauty of science as well as the depth and purpose within these scientific principles that reach across the bench into our minds and into the world of engineering, robotics, AI, and even spirituality/purpose.
