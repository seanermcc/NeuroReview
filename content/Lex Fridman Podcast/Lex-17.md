Love this kind of episode for the early days of the 'Artificial Intelligence' podcast--crappy video, cool guest, and mostly good/fun questions from lex.  Greg was a very interesting and thoughful guy, and was very interestingly a lot like sam altman, who they ended up working on chat gtp together years after this podcast aired.   Its intersting to hear this convo years later, as a lot of the things they talk about become much more relevant and intersting and newsworthy, so the convo seems a bit ahead of its time.  For a classic comp sci AI guy, greg had a bit of humor and charisma that was great to see, and lex and greg had great flow and chemistry throghout.  My biggest complaint is how short this convo was and the lack of easy timestamps.
