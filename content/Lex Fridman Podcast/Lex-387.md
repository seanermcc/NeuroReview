George is definitely a computer scientist type of guy, and also has a very unique character compared to many others in the field or other powerful people Lex interviews.  However, with how much fun he has there, Lex continues to be serious and doesn’t joke around as much as id like with this conversation.  it was a bit wierd and uncomfortable at times, and while you really do get to know his story, i wish it was a bit different and more focused.

    This was one of my favorite Lex episodes I’ve listened to. I’ve done a complete 180 on my initial take on him and have come to respect all of his positions. He’s much more theoretically practical and pragmatic (in his way, at least), and the interview covers a lot of great things in the general tech-society paradigm. This is a great listen and you really get a feel for his personal mission - which I think is an admirable one to drive technology forward for society and challenge technological monopolies like Tesla and NVIDIA. I also find it somewhat intriguing how he views life as this game where the objective is to hack the simulation and “stand face to face with god”.  (8.9 Rating)
