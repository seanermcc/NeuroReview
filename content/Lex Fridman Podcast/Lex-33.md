pod_notes: 'Love to see a human side of something like Lockheed martin--generally
  called ''evil'' by the modern news and world. Keoki is a real human being solving
  real and interesting problems.  The mission of LM shines through Keoki and my main
  issue with this podcast is that its way too short and lex doesnt press enough on
  some of the tougher questions.  While he does ask some, could have been way more.  Highly
  recommend another podacst with Keoki now.  '
