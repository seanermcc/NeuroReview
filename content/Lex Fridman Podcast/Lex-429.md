'Life has patters; veins, roots, NEURONS. Profound statement of lex b4 this (~2hrs) about god and a creator. Man what an awesome convo in general--they dance through so many great topics around life and animlas, death, conservation, purpose, god, and even a real snake and bat and real shit they they have just recently done in the jungle. Plus they are lterally there and lex is in a suit LOL. Soo classic, so good, one of the best Lex pods in a while.
