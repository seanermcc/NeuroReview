This was an awesome and much needed perspective on the science/details/future of nuclear power. Really cool how a basic understanding of nuclear fusion is just a zoom into the sun and starts for 30-60 mins. The ientire idea is so complicated that it makes clear to me why we cant have this so commonly, noone gets it except the expert. And seeing/hearing someone talk about millions of degree chambers is just mindblowing—but theoretically it can be done (and has in a lot of contexts).  And its so called ‘safe’.  I wish Dennis would have spoken more on how the chamber is built and maintained.  There was a nice balance throughout of technicality and story, with a nice perspective that lex kept zooming out to which is the worldwide impact of these ideas.  Lex drew nice parallels often and dennis had some good anologies that helped put the ideas in context (laser for doing fusion=a perfect strike from 350 miles).  Overall, a good but technical and detailed episode.
