Some questions at the beginning were pretty weak/bad--wierdly walking through what poker is and not asking his personal history with poker and the game was a bit of a mistep in my opinion.  The convo got a lot better 15-20 mins in--the RPS analogy is something we see alot with the AI crowd (Oriol #20 mentioned this).  The way Tuomas thinks starts to come across in the back half, and that needed to be expaned to be 8+.
