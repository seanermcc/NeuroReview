Po is the ideal math professor everyone wishes they had. My favorite part was the way he teaches—tests are all things you don’t know and have to figure out. He teaches you to think, not to memorize. You could tell the way he thinks through ideas and questions that he really thinks deeply, but also spoke so clearly and nice it was refreshing to hear a math mind speak like this. This is a great pod for someone thinking about high level math, comp sci, engineering, ect.  A great one to start with out of the lex math nerds he has on, this is a top math podcast.
Then thinking how he was able to apply math to make an awesome covid tracking database, so neat.  This part was almost minor compared to the rest of the convo, which I appreciate.  Don’t focus too hard on one cool thing, get to others.  Loved this from lex
