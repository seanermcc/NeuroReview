This was a really cool topic and conversation, but something was a tiny bit off with clara’s ego/vibe.  She was a bit almost rude to lex (in a jokingly way) sometimes, and maybe this was their way of flirting?  But lex handled that great and asked good, classic questions about astronomy and planets and space and aliens.  All good stuff from lex, a bit of a lack of humility from clara, for example saying that she prefers to be called a ‘doctor in quantum astrophysics’, like chill and be a humble human like the rest of these great scientists.
