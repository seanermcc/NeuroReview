Devon is a cool and teddy bear like guy who is a study and beast at arm wrestlying but can actually talk and speak with emotion and grace, a nice combo. Not necessarily super humble, which was my biggest negative for him, but is still able to recognize other guys as being realy good at the sport.  An intersting dive into the sport of arm wrestingly I wasn’t really expecting, and a nice combo of detail of the sport and mental/psychological talk that is always nice with this kind of guest.
