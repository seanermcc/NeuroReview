Gustav is a very interesting, cool, and collected 'face' for spotify.  His personality and views on things are a microcosm for how spotify operates and functions.  He is very interesed in the usability, the user experience, and how music integrates into our lives.  There was also interesting talk about podcasting and how that is integrated, but besides these main points the conversation was not very broad.  Thus, it was a bit niched for those people who like and respect spotify, and didn’t get much deeper then that.
