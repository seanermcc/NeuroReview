What an interesting conversation about startups--full of awesome storys and powerful statements/rants from Jason about what it takes to make it in the cutthroat reality of what is entrepreneurship.  His relationship with Elon was really cool, and Lex and Jason had some great chemistry throughout. They have some nice chats about social media, specific startups jason has done (Robinhood/Wallstreet bets), and a really great discussion about work/life balance (basically that the saying/idea is BS).  Then lex asks a great question towards the end about the importance of love, relationship, and family in these startups.  And Jason is amazed at the question and tells a great story about elon, but without sayin it he implys that that is what matters most!  Even more than money.  A great convo and WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING ON AGAIN
