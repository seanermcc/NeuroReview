Boris knows his stuff, and he is most definitely the kind of guy you want to design/code/work on a robot, or on self driving vehicles.  Something abuot his dimeaner which is so focused and passionate but still with an ability to communicate makes him a great person to have on a podcast that is niched in AI and robotics.  Lex’s excitement is shown here, and its nice to see.  But it gets a bit too niche at times, and too technical for a non expert to follow.  Lex does a decent job bringing things big picture, expecially later, but the big chunks at beginning and middle were niched into technicality, although some of the techincallity about cosmo and the business is interesting to a wider audience.
