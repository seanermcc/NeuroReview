Lex always does a decent convo with the judo guys, especially if you’re into Judo. But if you areny a judo gut, this is a bit too niche.  Some more slowing down and explaining the basics for us novices would have been nice.  Also backround of some of the people, and jimmy, and his personal story, would have been great. But his minset, coaching style, how to train, motivate people and himself, were all felt very strongly. They touched on some touchey and interesting topics (putin or olympic committee), which I would have liked more of. The saga and drama of lex and the olympics sharing of film is awesome and the best example of it is here in this pod, saved this podcasts rating imo.  Ok for judo, meh in general.
