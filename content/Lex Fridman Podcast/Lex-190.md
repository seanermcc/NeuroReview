'Real stuff is complicated'--when asked a question if you cant explain something simply you don’t understand it.  I like the way this answer was, kind of fun.  But in general this conversation was hard for me to follow for some reason and I found myself having to go back and listen twice (or 3 times) to many parts.  For example, they talk about ferats last theorem and don’t really explain what it is.  They name drop many math guys but don’t explain who they are or give enough background for a naïve listener.
