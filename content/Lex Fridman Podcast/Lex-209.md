These two guys are cool—they saw a problem with science and research and papers and went for it and made an open source annotation library for papers, trying to make them easy to read.  Im impressed.  It was funny, I couldn’t really tell the differnece betweeen the two voices, they sounded exactly the same.  Looking at their pic its like the same guy with a beard.  They go into great detail about their Fermat’s library and what it is and how they made it, interesting for any academic and aspiring scientsist, and then it gets a little fun/crazy towards the end.  This felt a bit long for how focuesd it was, and if you arent into scientific reseaerch it might not be for you.  But a cool niche scientific pod.
