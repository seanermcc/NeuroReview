This convo had some nice background into IBM, watson, the first wave of AI and natural language processing, and the intellectual details of jeopardy. This made for an exciting conversation, that really marked a breakout into the ‘long’ long form conversations that lex likes to do after this (3+ hours).  This convo went deep into a lot of nice philosophical and relevant ideas that become pinnacles of lex podcasts moving forward.  Tocuhes on questions about  love, conciousness, mortality, intelligence, and reasoning, in a somewhat deep and interesting way.  But would have even wanted more of this from this episode.
