Lex was obviously star struck here--Vladimir had just given a lecture in his class, is a beast in the field of comp sci and also a big time russian scientists. And lex does try to get some big picture questions and 'push back' on vladimir at many points, but i feel it was terribly done. Vladimir would try to explain ideas and answer questions and lex would stop him and interrupt and try to claim to be 'simple' and ask more basic questions, and then would ramble on with the question which would then vladimir in certain ways and away from his previous thought. This left me as the listener confused and not really following what vladimir was saying and instead i was distracted by Lex's awkwardness and pushyness into the conversation. I would have loved more of a 'let him speak' style with actual simple questions. For example, Lex asked what a predicate is, and vladimir says 'i dont know'. Lex then pushes for a minute or two to try to explain what he meant but instead should have let a pause happen (like he does many a time), and then let Vladimir explain himself. I found myself re-listening to multiple parts here trying to feel to profoundness of what Vladimir was saying at times, and still had a difficult time getting much from it. Definitively if you are deep into computer science Vladimir is a person worth knowing of and hearing speak, but for anyone else this conversation is a very difficult one to enjoy. I would highly, highly recommend trying to HAVE VLADIMIR ON AGAIN for a redemption (of Lex) and to give Vladimir a great way of leaving an online legacy instead of with this.
