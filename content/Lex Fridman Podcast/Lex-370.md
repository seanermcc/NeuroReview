Edward is a really interesting guy and thinker, and this convo is really interesting and somewhat classic for lex at this point. They jump across different topics elegantly, and seeing how edward thinks is cool. He draws a lot of connections with other experts, the einstein stuff for example is cool. But he doesn’t come across as humble as you’d like from a badass mathmetician, although he definitely is.  There was also some weird pauses throughout, which werent as natural as some other peoples (Elon for example) that made this interview a bit more awkward than it needed to be.  Also referencing his own book a lot wasn’t that humble.
