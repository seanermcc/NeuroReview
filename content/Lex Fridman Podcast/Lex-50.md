This was a cool discussion, with a nice balance between technical algorithm and psychological fairness/game theory/real world implications. It was neat to hear the long term connection of these two back in undergrad, which made the convo feel like it was one of those situations/friendships where no time passes. This convo was natural and fun, while also being somewhat deep and interesting at times. A lot of the bigger philosophical quesrtions that lex likes to ask were missed, which was a bit of a bummer given Michaels personality, as well as his story was not touched on. But this convo was niche and profound at times,, and gave a nice big picture open minded view at data and privacy and fairness that would be great for someone either just starting out or deep into programming.
