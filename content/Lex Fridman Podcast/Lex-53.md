This was way too short, and there was some bad questions from lex that did not do well in a short pod (for example his big picture meaning of life and death was silly here). We needed this way longer, with more stories, more thoughts, and just more!  The video is also necessary to make this exciting. Sad that this was too simple, shallow, and soft, as it could have been so much better and hit harder given who noam is.
