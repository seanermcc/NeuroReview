This conversation was kind of interesting, but was very shallow and too short to really get into the topics at enough detail.  Additionally there were a handful of weird questions from lex, like the utopia one for example. Plus lex teases us with the intro with an inteersting and cool backstory about Paul as a nobel laureate and some drama with the NYT, but they don’t discuss.  I would have loved some more background and push into his controversial writings.  This needed to be 3+ hours, and lex should have on again.
