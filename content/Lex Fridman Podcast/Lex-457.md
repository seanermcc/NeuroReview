This conversation was a bit enlightening to me, where I was able to get a clear understanding and perspective of milton friedmen, kaynsean economics, and how this fits in with the history of money and power.  They went the perfect depth into most ideas, and jennifer was never really speaking over our heads and explained her ideas very well and without much bias. I actually appreciated the background and nuance of the different economic thoughts, and love lex when he gets into this kind of mode—which is like tell me the definitions and the basics and then tell me again and more about them.  This is helpful with ideas within history and economics, as there is much nuance and complications that make these ideas not as intuitive as you would think. The biggest negative is that this podcast wasn’t very broad, and didn’t tell many stories to keep your interest.  SO it felt a bit dull at times and I had to relisten to many parts. But if you are niterested in history and/or economics this is definitely a must listen, and otherwise could listen on 1.5x and get something good out of it.
