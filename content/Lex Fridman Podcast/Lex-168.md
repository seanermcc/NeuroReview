Something felt kind of off here—Silvio wasn’t directly pompous, but he didn’t come off very humble.  He had this sound or attitude of confidence but didn’t really make enough sense or speak with enough clarity to get his points across in a simple way.  So this made it really hard to follow--I listend to this 2x and didn’t really get much from it.  Also lex asked a bit random questions, especially in the second half, which I think made Silvio go down weird rabbit holes.  At beginning they were a bit focused on crypto and blockchains, and he expalined this ok, with a bit too much detail and not enough examples or real life ideas.  This is not one I would recommend to start on for Lex’s crypto/economics saga.  Also I didn’t really get much of the algorand point, or know what it is, so im not sure it was focused on enough—but it was in the title and people liked this in the comments.
