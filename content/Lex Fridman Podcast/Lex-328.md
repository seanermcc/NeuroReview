This was a very judo techinical podcast and focused, which was hard for me to follow sometimes as an outsider.  They mention a ton of names and moves and watch a lot of film that made this a difficult pod for audio only, and closed off for a lot of people not familiar with the people and moves, like myself.  But the ending was cool, discussing the animals and fighting, especially after I’ve gotten to know john and lex and their relationship.  This episode has to be watched after the first few with john, cant just be jumped in unless you love judo.
