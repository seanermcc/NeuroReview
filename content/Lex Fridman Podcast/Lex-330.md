Lex and Hikaru really have some good chemistry here--better than with magnus or other chess people he's had on.  They do a lot of talking about chess for the first half, but they start to get into deeper ideas and getting into how Hikaru thinks and what he thinks about others and himself.  The last 30-45 mins was great getting into his life and his story and the rapid fire at the end was one of the most well done rapid fire questioning I've ever heard--from both the question and answer perspective.  The cheating in chess part was also interesting, thinking about what that actually means and why it would work.  Overall I got more than just a chess dependent world view from a top player in the world, and instead got great insight on how to be good at anything and try and live a humble life while still striving for your passion.
