What a suprisingly loving, passionate, and powerful conversation with a new york firefighter.  His story was great, but they didn’t stick on the specifics of 9/11 too long (the perfect amount actually).  Instead lex got to his bigger story, fighting lukemia, his faith in humanity, love, problems/solutions for society.  The flow of this podcast was so good and genuine and there was just a beautfiul emotion (almost holy spirit vibe) coming off of Niel throughout that kept me listening and attentive throughout.  The passion of his friendships and people like him who are looking after first responders, the lack of polictics was great, and even some of the war/brave stuff at end was elegently spoken.  A great conversation for anyone proud to be an american, or who respects first responders, or even who just wants to see what a giving service minded human is like.
