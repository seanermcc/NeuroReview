While this conversation was neat that is was in the metaverse, it was much too short and lex was way too entralled by how cool the thing was to ask good questions.  I like better when lex goes to the conversation with a more open mind and less bias about how great and exciting things are.  Instead, this conversation made Lex feel like a little boy and Mark feel like the genious inventor who was elevated into this perfect type of human who is going to fix the world.  Instead i like the vibe of the first 2 conversations where i got to know mark and lex together and you were both just humans.  Getting the point across that the metaverse can be alot like human interaction, although you said it a bunch lex, didnt really get across as well as i think you would like.
