This was another solid pod, that was very similar in vibe to the David and Perter podcasts around it (so a nice string of a few similar episodes, not sure if this was on purpose). Gary was very opinionated and less open minded then a lot of other people in the space of comp sci and cognition, which made for a interesting conversation. He was still respectful and humble though, and was good at seeing the flaws in approaches and lex’s ideas (I like when he would kind of cut lex off and just say ‘no’ or ‘not really’). This was a bit short, and given his style meant there wasn’t that many topics that were touched on, which is main reason for low rating.  But would definitely want to see on again.
