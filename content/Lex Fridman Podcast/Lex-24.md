Rosalind is a great mind and deep thinker in the world of computer science, but not in the nitty gritty way most comp sci pople are. She is a deep thinker in the world of human emotions and interface for programs. She is very humbble and quick to admit we don’t know things and is also informative about the big picture of AI and how it does (and does not) relate to our emotions. My biggest issue is how short it is, I would have loved to know more about exactly what she does and why she does it, and what kind of questions she is asking  in her research and day to day work.  Should definitely HAVE ON AGAIN.
