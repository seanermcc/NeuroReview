Really cool to listen back on now.  Some of the points on social media are really relevant now, and its neat to see how far Lex has grown to this point as a conversationalist. The respect that lex has for wienstein and vise versa is really founded here, and comes out beautifully in later episodes. But the way they are willing to discuss taboo topics so non-chalant is a reason why both these men are so great.
