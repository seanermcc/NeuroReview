Lex does a great job helping everyone see how Mr. Beast's mind works, and at the same time actually seems to ask questions and give ideas to Mr. Beast that he hasn’t necessarily heard before.  They discuss a lot of the details underlying youtube virality and how the video making, design of brands, and analytics work, which is cool coming from these two.  Its also interesting how much of a 'revolutionary' that Mr Beast Appears when questioned in this kind of way, as he seems to be putting all his eggs in the 'youtube' basket, although justifiably. Its interesting to think how adults or non-youtube people might feel about this podcast and think that its somewhat wrong, but seeing and knowing the success Jimmy has at such a young age speaks for itself. Lex never demeans or disrespects him or his efforts and sees it all as positive and good, which i think he could have given some more pushback here.  Jimmy is a bit confident, and lex feeds into that instead of pushing back.
