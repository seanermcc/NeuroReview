This convo is a bit short, and I just didn’t feel the usual passion and excitement from lex and especially not from Dan.  They talk about a broad range of topics, which I didn’t like because of the lack of excitement.  The fact that the guy made the 'Rev.ai' company was cool, but the story behind it would have been more interesting instead of just jumping in and talking about it.  Was he the founder?  Or does he just work there?  I would have liked more of his story, and more depth into some of the discussions they had.
