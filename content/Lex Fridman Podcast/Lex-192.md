This episode got into some comp sci jargon at times for me that made it hard to get through.  Plus it was so damn long as I was listening now (in 2024) I kept thinking ‘I’ve heard parts of this’ but cant remember what parts of it I listened too already :/.  So this was a bit of a burden for me to get through, but I still did and there was definitely a lot of deep thought, philosophy, religion, science, you just had to get there.  Maybe 1-2 hours was spent on this bigger pic stuff, and 2-3 on more specific cardano, wolfram, and software related stuff
