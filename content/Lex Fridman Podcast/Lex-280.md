This podcast was a bit weird. Unlike lex to have such a short podcast, especially this far in (ep280).  Cristiano gives off vibes with short and this that he’s a big deal, and lex kind of acts like he is, but I just feel like he really isnt relative to other guests.  But they really only touch surface level on a variety of potentially interesting topics, and some answers were so short from Amon it was a bit shocking.  Lex acted like a weird android fanboy and was too caught up in it to ask better questions and keep christinao on topic for long enough to make for an interesting discussion.  This needed to be 3-4 times loner, and they needed to discuss more touchey, important issues instead of just saying ‘oh qualcomm and android are so great yay’.  Because everyone know they arent.  Noone even knows what qualcomm is...
