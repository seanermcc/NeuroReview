This is a nice discussion on something lex loves, relationships with robots. The way kate goes about this is nice and careful and open minded, but also has a very nice big picture view of how robots can interact and help with people and their daily lives.  Most of these questions have been asked to others in different ways, but the question list was almost made for kate it felt like. All her answers were right on and felt true and good. These two had some nice chemistry, and this is a must listen if you care about robots and how they could fit into human life.  So a bit niche, but pretty good.
