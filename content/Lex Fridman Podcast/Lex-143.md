This is a cool relationship for lex--his trainer, friend, but also someone who is candid and speaks their mind and isnt afraid of putting themselves out there.  They touch on so many different topics, from war, to politics, to fighting/mma/judo of course, but even  books/movies and instagram/social media.  Interesting insight and convo, and fun at times.  But felt a little all over the place.  The end was cool to see lex reversing the script on his mentor by giving him some advice on podcasting.  You don’t get to see lex like this very often, the confident and go getter vibe, but we all know its there and nice to see.
