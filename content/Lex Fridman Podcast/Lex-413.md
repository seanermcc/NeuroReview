It took me a while to realize how rich bill was, which was an interesting thing. The first half I kind of thought he was a failed investor based on his stories, and I think this says something about him and lex's discussion and how someone who is really rich can have a somewhat more humble/failed begininng. It seems that he has learned a lot.  But towards the back end the convo got a bit political, which I thought was unneccssary--althought the DEI discussion was interesting.  It was also a good lead in into Neri, who I didn’t know was his wife, but that story was great and I wish it would have been moved up int his podcast.  Im not sure listeners will get that far and this was a MUST listen as far as Neri and Lex go, who had one of the best podcasts previously.  So I call Bill Neri's husband to emphasize how great neri is and its especially sad she's getting slandered.
