Lex and Simon touch on a number of interesting things, but they only touch them briefly. Simon was somewhat humble but his ego was there--talked about his book alot and didnt talk about others much. Lex on the flip side wasn't confident enough, talked about other peoplet too much and seemed nervous to challenge Simon. But he did, and this made for an intersting convo, where Lex felt the awkwardness but Simon had to reassure him that it was ok and he was enjoying it. Simon would be a great person to have on NOW (4 years later), and a have a more full, deep, conversation about Simon's life. I'd be interested to know how someone becomes a writer about leadership, without necessarily leading something (or did he? Would be good to know). HAVE ON AGAIN is my final recommendation, and make it at least 4 hours.
