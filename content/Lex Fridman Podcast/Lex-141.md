So was awesomely surprised at Erik’s swag, charisma, and voice given his last name...was expecting a techy/nerdy/foreign guy.  What an awesome researcher, in a unique field.  It was clear, without him saying it, that he cared deeply about mentoring and teaching, while also being so knowledgable of his field and research. Then what was more suprising was his ability to communicate his findings in an interesting and informative way.  He also had a lot of opinions, mostly backed by facts, that made this convo flow very nicely and was overall a great convo about economics and tech.  A neat collaboration that I didn’t think would be so profound.
