This was a bit short for my liking, and Lex talked way too much about his roombas and how they suffer.  Then he randomly dcomes in and plugs the book unnecessarily, I wish this was done more naturally. The depth of this convo was a bit shallow for Lex, and I wish there was more insight into Singer’s mind and thinking and how he really came to his big ideas regarding animal suffering.  Wish some more discussion on the soul and religion as well, instead this convo was only a few topics and somewhat shallow.
