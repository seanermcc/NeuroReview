Travis is objectively an awesome dude---family man, cs nerd, philosopher, and good communicator.  What a rare combo.  His work ethic, but also work-life balance, and his passion and desire for impact was amazing. This was technical, but never too technical, and I was constantly brought along the story by lex and Travis just kept slam dunking the ally oop questions lex gave.  It was constantly interesting for 3 hours, filled with amazing stories and insights about life and coding and business and family.  This is a must listen for a cs person, especially a scientific coder, and is a great place to get into lex with a minor interest in coding.
