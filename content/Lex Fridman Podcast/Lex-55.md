Soooo much chemistry between the two of them, its actually so adorable and nice to see this side of lex.  Lex trying to be fun and funny is actually so fun and funny, especially after you know him from watching so many podcasts.  Great break in his normal convos.  But then it was cool to see whitney so real and passionate and psychological, which made for a really great conversation.  They should talk again definitely, but this is one of the best older lex podcasts and ireally think started a turning point for lex to really find himself and start being who he really wanted to be, instead of just the AI guy.
