I see a pattern emerging with Lex, where he has historians and deep thinkers on who know about complex and complicated cultures/ideas, and then has the leader on.  I hope he has Xi Xingping on, would be so cool.  Its neat to see how lex has opened his mind to china and their culture, as he has mentioned previously many times how he is sad that he doesn’t know or understand their culture.  Well lex, this is how you learn! This was a great nuanced convo on all things china that are contentious and popular--I felt it got deep but not super broad.
