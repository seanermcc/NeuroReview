What an incredible conversation, and this is the essence of the power of podcasts.  Kanye was off the rails at this time, and was all over the place because of it.  But Kayne is a seminal figure in pop culuture, and most people are not letting him speak during this antisemitism thing he went on.  But lex let him speak, and say it out, and say it to his face.  And Lex took it and challenged the points that he felt were most problematic, especially Jewish Media and the holocaust.  Awesome.  So inspiring to see lex, who anyone who's watched him knows is just a kid doing his best, to go up 'against' Kayne during this time and really let him be heard and also not let him stop on top of him.  What an incredible skill.  You get to hear Kayne out and make your own opinion of him with this conversation, something NO media was doing at this time.  The power of podcasts really came out here, which is why this rating is so high.  Not necessarily as an endorsement of Kayne, but as an example for why a podcast is so necessary and powerful to understand pop culture and media and people.
