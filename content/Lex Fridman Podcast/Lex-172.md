Ryan is very mature and well spoken for his age, and his story is pretty cool about how he made the startup. This actually felt a little long, but stayed mostly interesting throughout. The ending portions about mortality and advice hit different and weakly because of Ryans lack of experience. But the first 2 hours was very solid, and they touched on a lot of philosophical and ideological points about social media, freedom, speech, and programming that were a nice perspective that was easy to follow relative to lex’s normal guests.
