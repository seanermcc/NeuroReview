Dawkins is a great thinker and a poster child for science and truth and reality.  There was a nice little push from lex into big/contentious ideas that dawkins elegantly disagrees with (mostly, at least).  This made for a really good convo where we don’t just see the normal dawkins anti regilion and pro genetics/biology, but instead we get into these fun/deep questions about meaning and purpose. It’s a bit too short to have too many things that are profound, but its almost there, and if someone is a scientist and has not listened to Dawkins or read his books this is a great place to start.
