So they must have talked about hans neiman for an hour, and I felt this was way too harped on and focused.  But the anal beads chess joke came out of it and it was pretty funny at times, so added some humor on the dead horse that was getting beaten.  It got a bit chess niche and cheesy at the end, especially when lex is hyping up gotham and his youtube and saying how great he is.  Gotham does a good job of trying to stay humble.  They have some good talks on magnus, the impcat of chess, and what it takes to get good at something and how to do it.  So this was pretty decent for a chess focused pod, but got too focused at times and could have stayed bigger picture longer.
