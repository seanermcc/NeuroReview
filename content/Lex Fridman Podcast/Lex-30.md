This felt like small talk.  Some big questions, but Kevin was too fast and hard to follow and a bit too quirky for lex at this time in his podcasting.  Lex didn’t ask enough big, tough, or interesting questions to lead the convo into something good or worth listening too.  Instead it feels kind of all over the place, and no story comes out of Kevin an dhis life, and instead it was just a quick brief gloss over microsoft and AI.
