This was a very important conversation.  Especially for young people, who are grown up with a weird minor islamafobia.  Putting to the front of our minds the complex nature of the events surrounding 9/11, the people within afghanistan, and a historical perspective on the entire thing is extremely enlightening.  While i wish the convo would have been a bit more in depth of some of Crews' stories, it was still very good.
