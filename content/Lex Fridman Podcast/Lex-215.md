Man, Wojciech’s voice is just tough to listen to. He is most definitely smart and knowledgable, and even a deep thinker with some wit and philosophical ideas that were very interesting. But the power of his ideas doesn’t hit like others ecause his voice and the vibe with lex was just a bit off. Still, this podcast did have some pretty good content and questions, where issues and ideas were discussed around AI and machine learning and robots, all of lex’s favorites. Woszeck had good opinions and ideas and I liked his discussions on consciousness and thought. He was very well rounded and open minded for a CS guy.
