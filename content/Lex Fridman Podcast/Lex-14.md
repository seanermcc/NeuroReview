Its refreshing to hear someone in the space of tech advancement, start ups, and comp sci business to be so well spoken and normal.  Kyle is a great thinker and can jump back and forth from high level to details elegantly, and my only complaint about this podcast is about how short it is.  I would love to know more about Kyles story--especially cruise.  This is oviously something lex is super excited about, so at this point 5 years later lex you NEED TO HAVE KYLE ON AGAIN PLEASE!! This is a Great podcast for one of the first few.
