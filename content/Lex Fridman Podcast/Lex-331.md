Balaji is able to go and go and go with so much energy and confidence and excitement for 7+ hours.  This fact makes this podcast somewhat astonishing.  Lex beings to get a bit tired and slow(er) after a while, especially last hour or so, but Balaji could have kept going it felt like.  They discuss so many big topics and nuances that were great to hear and dive into, although the idea of the network state took me tx times to listen to before I understood.  The discussion on the FDA was a bit wild, academia and publishing was interesting, new countries was kind of a crazy idea that was neat, and politics discussion was also good. Balaji speaks with such conviction and clarity and power that is great for anyone to listen to to learn how to speak and have charisma. You cantell he is so well read.  But annoying he kept refering his book—just tell us the information and be humble. This episode was a milestone in that it was so long and lex did great and bajali did better.  Impressive conversation by both.
