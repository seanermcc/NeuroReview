This was a really cool and deep and powerful dive into the mind of a small, female who went to war.  And who saw a lot. And who worked through it to come out of PTSD stronger and better.  Lex takes Kelsi into the darkest parts of her past and psyche, often what felt like too dark/deep, but Kelsi handled it great and only teared up 2-3 times.  Was interesting to see some shade for kelsi on the internet, people said when she went on Jocko was bad.  This I feel is a bit underrated maybe because it’s a woman veteran?  Or people think she’s blowing smoke?  Im not so sure I felt that, her convo felt genuine and real imo.
