Leslie seemed nice and kind, but this made for a bit of a soft and gentle type of computer science interview that I felt lacked in excitement, motivation, and purpose.  Lex had leslie jump around from specfiic topic to specific topic, which left me a bit confused and disoriented as a non comp sci person.  But I am a scientist, and I still had a hard time following this in any story like fashion.  Rather, it felt more like a laundry list of questions that lex asked and leslie answering them somewhat robotically.  Would have liked a bit more background and then ease into depth to make topics and stories to give leslie a more personable feel.
