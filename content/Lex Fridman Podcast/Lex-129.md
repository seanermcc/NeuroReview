Lisa and Lex got off to a bit of a rough start, where lex had a few weird/bad questions where Lisa was just like ‘Not Really’.  But then they started to clique about 30-45 mins in, and it got interesting, deep, philosophical, and even political, in a very neuroscientific/mind-centered way.  I like how lex pokes in and out of emotions and what they are and Lisa elegantly references parts of what she has written and said in a really nice way.  She really has some gems of statements in there throughout, my favorite is about cultivating awe and brilliance, and how that is how she lives her life.  Her stance on politics is also refreshing and open midned with a left lean, which you don’t always see.  She has a great NPR voice (as lex says) and overall makes for a really strong and good and hopeful/positive conversation cetnered on our minds and emotion.
