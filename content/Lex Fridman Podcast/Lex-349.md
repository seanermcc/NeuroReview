Bhaskar was a great speaker and voice of an idea like socialism.  It often comes across as anti capitalist and hateful, and bhaskar is the opposite.  Very open minded and informed and just convinced that socialist ideas are the best for everyone.  From this perspective, it’s a very selfless and hopeful ideal and dream to give everyone things like healthcare and school and opportunities.  Its just not always real.  Lex does some pushback, but  I would have wanted him to do some more.  Love the bonding over bernie, MLK and einstein surprise and excitement over being socialist.  Also it was refreshing to hear someone not be so darn emotional and hateful talking about this stuff, and would lvoe to see Bhaskar on again and maybe in a ‘debate’ with a ‘capitalist’ of some sort.
