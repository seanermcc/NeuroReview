Sundar comes across very genuine and a very good person.  He seems to see the world very open minded and objective, but still passionate at times.  As a family man, and someone who came from little, his whole life purpose and meaning stemming from what technology can do for you (from water heater and first phone), into google and through google chrome to google CEO.  A really cool story.  I kinda felt this wasn’t as long and as detailed as I would have liked, especially on some of the more contentious/issue points (Elon, AI safety, crappiness of android, ect).  But this was very much worth the listen and another great perspective on a big time CEO from a bit time company.
