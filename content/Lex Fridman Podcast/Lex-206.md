I had a tough time paying attention and following this conversation for some reason.  Felt like lex talked a lot and didn’t really ask direct questions very often.  I do know they talked a lot about Banna's, and cats and dogs, and that its really hard to get these computer vision programs to do edge cases and see/think like a human.  Definitely if you want to know about computer vision this is a great convo, but a bit too focused and kind of hard to follow with excitement.  Some of the fun/big questions lex usually asked were barely answered (ex. Are we in a simulation, answ: 'No'.) Would have liked more creative thinking/insight from Ishan and more push from lex.
