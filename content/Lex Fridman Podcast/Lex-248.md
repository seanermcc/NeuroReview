This is somewhat of a classic for Lex, a guy who knows russian, who's a historian, and is very insightful/thoughtful about the hitsory of genocide and power and these terrible times of war.  Lex gets very passionate at times, something you don’t see very often and happens in the 2nd half a good amount here.  Lex does  a nice job of flowing through dark topics, as usual, and looking for hope and goodness at the end.
