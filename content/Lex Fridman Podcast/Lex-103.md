This conversations was super long (even too long), and went up and down in quality/entertainment/information. I felt the first half was super solid, focused, got dep into agi (sometimes too deep for me personally), and Ben got to tell a lot of great and relevant stories. I felt like I was along the ride of how AGI was made (or at least the term) for the first half of this, and it was nice/cool.  But then once we got to the yan lecunn facebook beef, things went a bit downhill, and ben started to urk me a bit. He was unnecessarily combative, and then his thoughts on mortality and living forever were a bit egotistical and non realistic. Lex could have pushed back on this and a lot more in the back half, and he didn’t, making this have an overall bad ending and leave me with a poor taste after a really solid start.
