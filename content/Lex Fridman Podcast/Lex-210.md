This was neat when I first listened that I remember, and even neater years later to come back to and see both lex and matt so startstruck about one another.  And they end up having a mini argument, or basically lex pushing back, about the importance of sleep but also the importance of living life and passion.  It’s a really fun conversation relative to Matt’s normal more nerdy/huberman like style, where lex touches some into his story at times.  But also Matt does a good job making it more lex focused, where they talk about cars and driving for a while and matt specifically mentions how AI is cool, going out of his usual ‘mechanisms of sleep’ vibe, which he still constantly had.  There wasn’t as much detail as matt usually goes into—or maybe im biased at this point from the 6 episode series, but when he does its really great and easy to follow and understand.  I feel like he went a bit big on dreams and the importance of them, didn’t feel super legit—should check into this.  But besides that everything was interesting and important and once again answered the questions (in part)--why do we sleep?  Cool that they  didn’t sell the book.
