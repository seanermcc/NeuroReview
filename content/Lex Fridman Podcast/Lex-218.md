This convo was a bit weird, as it had the makeup of a potentially powerful and interesting convo, but was a bit too short and weird at times.  I don’t feel lex pushed into enough of the cool aspects of Jarons life, and Jaron drove the conversation and cutoff lex too much that was a bit annoying.  The worst part was when he decided to give his own advice to people, when all lex asked was was about defining moments.  Felt like he dodged that questiona nd a few others, like about his mother which was a bit short.  More into the actual background and story of Jarons life, for example like how he became a CS, how he made VR, why he did it, how, his family/work balance, all of that would have made a lot of what he spoke and had strong opinions on a bit more in context.
