Way technical throughout, kinda fun and lex asks good questions, but jeff goes too deep too often and this was hard for me to sit through. But when they get into black hole and evolution of universe I was back into it and excited, and I liked that part and talking about lee smolin (who has also been on lexs pod) was neat.  The second half of this pod gets a lot better and the end talking about aliens and hearing Jefs logic and the dance with lex was really cool.  Would recommend speeding through first half (unless you are highly interested in semiconductors and 'optoelectrics') and then giving a good listen to the second half and especially the end.
