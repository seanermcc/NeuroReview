Lex has referenced WWII so much, and its about time he had a truly WWI focused conversation and historian.  This reminded me a bit of the WWII in color netflix documentary, except for podcast version.  It was really eye opening and interesting to see many of the little things and details surrounding the war, and how small issues can lead to catastrophic consequences.  Lex is great at trying to see the rationale and reason behind many of the decisions and leaderships, and James and Lex just vibe so well with this kind semi-deep discussion on a dozen or so key ideas in the war.  Its always great when a convo like this flows through chronologically and across the region but without feeling scripted or biased.  This is a pretty niched episode, but a top one about WWII at that.
