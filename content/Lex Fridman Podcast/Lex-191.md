This is an absolutely classic, long, nuanced, fun, exciting, enlightening, deep, broad, and just overall fantastic podcast. Convos with modern philosophical minds like Daniel (or others would be like Dave Chalmers, Sam Harris, or even Lee Cronin) are the staple of the Lex podcast.  Lex does a great job diving deep into points he thinks are interesting, which are inevitabley what I thought was interesting, and gives Daniel time to think and speak deeply with all of the questions and ideas.  My favorite part was when they started talking about governance and society (which went on for a long long while, maybe 1 hr plus), and Daniel says that democracy’s main goal is to educate their people scientifically.  This to me is what I feel and hear from lex’s rhetoric around government and socitey, and Daniel exxplains it elegantly and references Jefferson/Washington while doing so.  What a powerful point.  This episode is full of intersting and enlightening bubbles that pop on you at different times, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND HAVING DANIEL ON AGAIN NOW!
