This conversation was focues on youtube a content, so it is a bit niche. For me personally this was really interesting, considering my desire to try and make online content, but if that’s not you much of this conversation would be too niche and more philosophical rather than directly relevant/interesting. This convo was made during covid so that also distracted a lot of it and made it a bit willy nilly.  Additionally, both Lex and Grant tried to be funny throughout but that is just not their style. This was bit up and down, and had a lot of good in it, but could have been much better.  I’d recommend having Grant on again as he is an awesome personality!
