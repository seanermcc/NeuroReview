This episode is so good with what is happeneing in the middle east right now. So much emotion and passion is happening on the news and within people, but the reality of the situation is more historic and needs to be taken from a realistic perspective.  Therefore, this conversation was critical for giving an objective, thoughtful, and detailed understanding of not just isral vs. hamas, but any conflict and war or even potential conflict that might occur.  The perfect amount of history and current events, along with the way you guys dove across different conflicts and time periods so naturally, made this a very great conversation.
