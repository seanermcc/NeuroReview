This was really solid, interesting, and a history packed conversation about the guy who wrote (and is still rewriting current versions) of the most widely used AI textbook.  Good discussions on teaching, AI, google, and how to write textbooks and make courses (a bit niche) that was all interesting but a bit shallow at times, given the short time constraint of this podcast. This episode adds to the little run of solid AI podcasts lex has with bigger name people around this time that helped him to break out into bigger stuff.
