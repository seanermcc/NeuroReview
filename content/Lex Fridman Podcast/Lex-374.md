A classic lex episode at this point, getting to know and in the mind of an excited roboticist who happens to be a CEO of a huge company.  This was consistantly high level and not too technical, which was nice for an outsider of CS and a general audience.  But it was still really cool to see the details of how a company like this is born, how to hire good people, and also how to make and design and think about robotics and the future of them.
