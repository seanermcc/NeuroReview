Started talking about olympics, then talk about judo/olympics and greatest ever and watch judo up to 1.5 hours.  This should have gone at end of 3+ hour podcast but not at beginning.  As an outsider of judo and Neil Adams, I didn’t really know what was going on, the signifigance of him, the sport, or the people. More background is needed for this episode to be easy to follow for the ley person.  If you are into Judo, you might like this.  If not, I wouldn’t necessarily listen to the whole thing, maybe put it on 1.5x and listen to the last hour or so.  Some decent insight on training to be an olympian or professional and having a winning/competitive mentality, but these are silver linings for an overall poor and uncharacteristic podcast for Lex.
