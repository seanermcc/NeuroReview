Brian is a pretty cool/normal guy, who speaks very very well for a CS guy.  He has some great humility and chill vibes, while also being confident and poised when discussing big ideas and qustions.  I thought lex did great here asking questions that were real and interesting, and waiting til the end to do bigger pothead like questions.  For a person like this I think that is great.  Honestly the vibes were really good, and I just wish this would have been longer. Brian was really interesting and more backstory mixed with more big picture ideas and thinkin could have put this up closer to a 9.  All together, a great convo for anyone interested in startups or crypto. But not too much crypto here!
