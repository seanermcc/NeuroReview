Stephen is such an interesting figure—an incredible thinker and idea generator. His demeaner and confidence are potent, and and make him a really engaging and exciting speaker. He indeed does have a bit ego, but lex discusses this directly with him, and lex even pushes this in the intro which I felt was unwarranted and unnecessary, biases a listener to inflate his ego. In reality, I felt Stephen was often open minded and answered a lot of questions with ‘we don’t know’, and followed that answer up with how you could answer the question. It makes lexs questions more impactful and interesting. The basics on computation, wolfram alpha, and complexity were very nice and helpful, and made for a nice dance from surface level to deeper ideas. This is a great starting place for lex podcasts on complexity, computation, and Stephen Wolfram, and I would recommend starting with this episode if you like Stephen.
