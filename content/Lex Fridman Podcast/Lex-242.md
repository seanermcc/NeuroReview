This was a weird conversation.  Felt like lex was acting like Ben was a huge deal and really big guy, and Ben was kind of trying to be funny and humble.  But that combo was a bit uncomfortable, and they ended up talking about a lot of random stuff, like for example paul and tyson and boxing and who would win and why.  Which is ok when someone is truly one of the best in the world.  But it wasn’t clear that Ben is a true professional and master, and he more came across as a regular dude and fan of the sport and of fighting.  Thus this convo had a cringey undertone throughout that was hard to get over.
