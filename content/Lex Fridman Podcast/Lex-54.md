This was a really inspiring and powerful conversation, and did a great job while being so short. They didn’t go too deep into anything, but discussed a lot of ideas that could be seen as simple in an elegant and interesting way, my favorite being this idea meritocracy that came up multiple times.  It’s a good way to make a team and come up with good ideas and be as ray says ‘open-minded and assertive’. This is a great pod for anyone with ambitions or dreams, and young aspiring people should most definitely listen to this and if they don’t know ray to get to know him some, especially if you are interested in money.
