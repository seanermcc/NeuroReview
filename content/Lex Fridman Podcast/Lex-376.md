This conversation was hard for me to listen to for some reason.  I went back to it multiple times and kind of listened to it mostly through in chunks, and then sitting down to listen to the whole thing was difficult for some reason.  I guess the problem for me was they start talking about chatGTP or some question and it goes a bit deep and somewhat off the topic and I get lost.  Or this could just feel somewhat redundent to some of the previous convos with steve, as I felt this was not the best of his normal.  But seeing the way Mr. Wolfram is and describes things just always makes me so confident in mathematics and engineering, since his personality IS wolfram mathematica.
