'Im a series of colors in someone elses painting' ---lex even re says this and uses it to ask about improv.  Its great.  Then he explains how acting can be like a sport/game, where even though rulses are the same each game is different and unique. Lex always does great interviews with actors, and this was good especially because of controversy, politics, good/evil.  Got to ask a lot of his deep questions while continuously dancing through some awesome stories and people that are important and impactful to kevin--his dad, house of cards, jack nicholosn, the other jack director.  Great podcast and well done by lex.
