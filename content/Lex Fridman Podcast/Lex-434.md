What does it take to make new knowledge?  ~1:33, a great point about AI and what perplexity wants to do.  This feels simple and expected as a human/scientist but thinking of it from trying to make a neural network that does this is interesting. This guy made perplexicty, basically a referenced and more reliable version of Chat-GTP.  And he speaks very highly, honestly, and humbly about others in the field--in a way that makes it sound like he doesn’t belong and that they are great.  This is how a good leader should sound--humbled.  They get a bit into the weeds of perplexity at times, which is fine as it was the first time I heard it.  But more of his story may have been nice.  Although it was weaved in, wasn’t super clear.  In total aravind is just a relatively simple and soft spoken person that makes for a not necessarily exciting podcast, but makes me think this is the kind of person iwant behind my big AI software.  Gives me humbler Sam Altman Vibes.  Good listen if you care about AI and chat gtp, but maybe a bit long and prolonged and perplexity focused for a normal listener.
