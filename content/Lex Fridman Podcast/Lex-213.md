pod_notes: 'Interesting and fun convo, I really like the end where you get deep on
  meaning of life and advice. Lex was a bit in awe the whole time and Barry was just
  a cool regular guy, so I think you could have related a bit better to him on a human
  level.  This didnt appear until the last 30 mins when you started talking about
  russian lit. '
