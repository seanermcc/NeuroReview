Something about the conversations with army guys who are science/engineering minded just scratches the podcast/conversational itch for me personally. Knowing that the guys piloting our insance aircrafts are so smart and technical and almost nerdy (ryan in a cool way) is so satisfying and makes me proud to be an american.  Ryan wasn’t quitte as cool and the episode wasn’t as good as Dave Faryvors (and it came after), but very similar vibes.  This one was a bit more AI and quantum focused, which is daves interest, and got into his new quantum computing job, which was too technical for me but could be interesting for others.
