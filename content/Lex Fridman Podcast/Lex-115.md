This was a really neat neuroscience/AI combined discussion from someone who is thinking about how to design the mind in AI and programs. Dileep is a good speaker and interesting guy, and explains the brain at a really nice level for those that might not be familiar. He does it with an almost childlike enthusiasm that is super refreshing in the realm of science. They start with some nice basic science that reminds me of Cricks ‘Astonishing Hypothesis’, basically through explaining the visual system you learn about the miracles and beaty of the mind. A cool idea he explains is that in order to make something like the brain, you need a well made perceptual system.  Basically percepts are necessary for concepts.  This is a cool fundamental idea that argues that further understanding of our senses, i.e. vision, can help us understand deeper aspects of the brain.  The end was kind of cute with books and meaning, very short, seems like Dileep is a classic nerd/researcher.  A great convo for those interested in Neuroscience.AI interface
