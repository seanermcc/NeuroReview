Dave was really well spoken and thoughtful, especially for being autistic (and very open about it).  Really humble and cool to chat about the stuff he made at microsoft--task manager, pinball, windows media manager.  And the way he made it was so non-chalant and just cool.  There was a basline level of excitement that was unusual for an autsitic person that made for a great convo, or it could have just been Lex's ability to keep the convo going and ask great questions.  But this was especially fun to lsiten to and follow, even outside of the programming space.  A little bit all over the place, but really cool and interesting perspective of someone with autism, of which they discuss directly (which is nice and refreshing in the space of science/engineering/programming), and then continue on to programming and big ideas and meaning.  A bit short, but the convo felt super efficient which is often not how Lex's pods go, so this was a bit refreshing.
