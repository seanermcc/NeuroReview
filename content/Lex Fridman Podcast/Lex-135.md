Lex asks charles a variety of questions, ranging from race to his classic meaning of life/death, to academics and rankings and then some computer science.  I actually liked that it didn’t get too nerdy and in the weeds of neuroscience, and Charles was able to be somewhat philosophical and big picture often.  This is something I don’t always see with these nerdy comp sci guys.  Then it felt kind of ballsy lex asking Charles about race, but he honestly answered it with humility and whitout a chip on his shoulder.  A very elgant discussion there in the science realm that is often avoided and if discussed, just directly assumed what will be said without much thought.  I liked Charles as a person, and actually didn’t get to see him much as a scientist. I think the convo with him and Michael littman will give more insight into that.
