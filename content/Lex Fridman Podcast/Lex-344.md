Noam is just such a normal kid vibe at first, but his life and thoguhts are so intersting. Made me so jealous about his PhD, the fact that he got to do something so cool that he loved that made an immediate impact.  Most PhD’s are not like this.  He explained so much of AI and poker so well, never was too technical, and lex was asking a lot of good big questions that made it feel like we were on the cutting edge with noam thinking about future application of these AI technologies. This is a great intro into AI episode for someone who is not a CS person.
