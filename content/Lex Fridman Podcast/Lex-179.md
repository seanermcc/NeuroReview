This was kinda cool to see lex so starstruck so early on as a podcaster—especially with how GSP handled it. The convo was fun and natural and normal, and even a bit weird at times (the colon discussion early was a turn off). Also I didn’t quite feel the whole ‘science of fighting’ idea that was in the title, and rather I felt more like george was emphasizing the ‘heart of training’. Or trusting the process. Something like that came across more than a scientific method, since science is all about passion and love for what you’re doing and the outcome—GSP was really emphasizing the process. Cool that they didn’t harp too much on specifics of fighting or MMA or wrestling, and it had an unexpected nice breadth of topics that kept my interest throughout as a non MMA or fighting guy.
