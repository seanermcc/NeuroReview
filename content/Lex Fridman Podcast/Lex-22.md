As far as an early lex podcast goes, this has some great high level questions. But still its kind of short and superficial when it comes to interesting parts of google and its implications. Rajat is very cool and kind and has a kind of swag that mostCS people don’t have (sorry tim), and I think better questions and topics would have made this hit even harder.
