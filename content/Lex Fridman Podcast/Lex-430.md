A big fun, but cringe (laughy/awkward at times), and a little too mechanistic at times.  But in general they do a good job cdancing from neuroscience principles to fun questions and big picture ideas, and the way you could tell charan was a fan of the podcast without him saying it was really cute/neat.  Lex's interest of the brain and memory was also obvious, they had a good tangent about AI and driving and lex makes a good quote about how 'every intersection is unique', an interesting idea I've heard lex talk about a lot where having intuition is so key for something like driving and something AI is lacking.  I like charan's positivity and willingness to discuss a few touchy issues (misinformation) while also being a humble scinetist.
