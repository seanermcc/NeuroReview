This was the best convo with Lee so far, no doubt.  The assembely theory was explained in a very informative and interesting way, while still a bit complicated. But the fact that so many people got upset, its published in nature, and he's so emotional about it, just lets you feel the power of the science. Power of the discovery, of the passion in the work done, the impact of the failure, the resilience to get through it. So much emotion comes through Lee here that hadnt been seen before, and this is absolutely what the lex podcast is all about.  What a great convo.  Plus alot of talk about free will, questions about god, AI, nucleur weapons, everything gets a little touch her.  Couldnt have asked for a better 3 hours of my life.
