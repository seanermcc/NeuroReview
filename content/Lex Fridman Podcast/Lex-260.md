This was a pretty solid 3x people podcast, and im pretty biased towards disliking the group format.  It was better since I had heard GSP and John previously, so i had more context about who they were. But still it was a bit all over the place.  Lex did good letting each person speak, but you didnt really feel like anyone got to fully be themselves with so many voices in the room.
