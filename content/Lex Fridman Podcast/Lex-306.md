This was a different conversation then the first episode with Oriol, which just goes to show you how depending on the questions someone can appear differently.  It seemed that oriol was a bit more serious, and talking bigger picture and really diving a bit into the Gato program.  I got a bit lost a few times, and need to watch this again to really get a good grip, but I did feel this was less engaging then the first time oriol was on.  He was kind of lame about some of the bigger questions lex asks and was afraid to have an opinion, so less on lex and more on oriol.  But as far as diving into AGI, gato, and general AI this was once again a good convo.
