I didn’t actually know who Jared was before I saw this, and it was really cool to see you give him a voice and so much credit and let him shine.  From what I read afterwords it makes sense that he gets thrown into the crazy trumper group but its so neat to see how smart, fastinating, well thought he is because of your interview style.  Really good.
