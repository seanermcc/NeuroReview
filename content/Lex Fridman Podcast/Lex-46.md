Garry and lex have some great chemistry, and lex does a great job interviewing here, especially considering this is one of the first 100 pods where he's a bit inconstant. Garry is so passionate and enthusiastic, and although not very humble, is somehow still kind and thoughtful. They dive quickly into some of lex's now classic chess questions, where here they kind of start the classicness of them, like 'who is the goat' and 'what do you think of AI beating human'. And better yet, Garry WAS the person that the AI first beat. Really cool to hear his thoughts on that. Their chess talk didnt get too in the weeds and was interesting even for me, someone who isnt a big chess enthusiast. Then they touch on russia very elegantly. But this pod was short, and could have been even better if it was longer. Would recommend to HAVE ON AGAIN, especially considering the russia/ukraine war and garry's influence.
