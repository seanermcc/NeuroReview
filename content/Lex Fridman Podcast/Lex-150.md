I felt like I was laughing along with michael at lex trying to be funny throughout this entire podcast. But it started to be a bit much. The other cool/funny part of this pod was the jumping from humorous and entertaining ideas to history and politics. I really enjoyed the serious/raw aspects of this podcast more then the attempted humor. But the humore really highlights their friendship, and is actually great at times. This is a good place to see the fun and friendly side of lex while still getting a little bit deep and dark as Lex and Michael are both known to do.
