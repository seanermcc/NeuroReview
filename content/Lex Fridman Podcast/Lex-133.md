This is a great and easy to follow conversation, frankly it is the best and easy to follow lesson on genetics and advaced genetics techniques I’ve ever heard.  More teachers and young scientists need to listen to this podcast. The analogies were great, the excitement and passion made me want to know why Manolis was so excited. But it got kind of weird at times with how lex was so interested in certain parts of the ideas.  It made for a funny/awkward dialogue at times where manolis was overexplaining things. I loved the excitement abou the future of technology, future of computational biology, and I wish and want more of this energy from other scientists. This is a must listen for anyone doing anything related to sequencing or genomics, I believe.
