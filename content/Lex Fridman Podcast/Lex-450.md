This was a nice jump for lex, back over to the democtrat side before the election. What you really get to see here is a politician who is truly for the people, so refreshing after listening to so many others and learning about the 'corruption' in the us government of ht elobbiests and the money and the power.  I heard to first when bernie was on Theo's podcast, and then heard it in detail from the young turks, but the numbers and size and power of lobbiests and interests of billionaires and hedge funds and investment companies and the military industrial complex and politics I mean holy shit. US is a massive oligarch. SO that’s very clear here and makes me have an open mind for bernie and his ideas and also for all ideas in general.
