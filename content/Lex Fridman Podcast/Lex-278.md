What a remarkable story and answer to the question 'what is your darkest moment'---skye watched as someone died after a wreck.  He said this shaped his career as a documentary filmmaker, but you could feel how this shaped his career.  He not only wants to document, but he wants to be there to help as well.  This is evident when they talk about lifeboat, where he actually saves people out of the water.  Plus the empathy he says he feels having any food he wants after visiting starving ppl in yemen.  Lex goes a little too deep into the weeds of filmmaking, but Skye is so humble and answers these questions so well which ends up not harping on the technicalities.  Instead they jump from deep topic to deep topic regarding how to choose, what you are filiming, the pupose of what Skye does, and meaning of life.  A great conversation and classic lex when it comes to topics around 'suffering'.  Lex was actually a bit too 'comical' at times, but this was ok and made the convo not too dark.
