Stephen is the perfect history buff, his voice, demeanor, and vibe are so perfect for a russian historian. Objective, blunt, and willing to speak his mind all the time with little fear of how it makes him seem—he is interested in facts and truth. They did a nice dive into lenin, stalin, and putin, and gave a great perspective on the russia/ukraine region that is a bit timeless given the war that ends up happening in a few years after this podcast aired.  Its eeire the question that lex asked: ‘do wars ever stop?’, and stephens blunt response: ‘No’.  Maybe we should all listen to historians more often.
