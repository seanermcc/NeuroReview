Lex went a bit hard on Ronald here—asking a lot of difficult and hardhitting questions in what ended up feeling like a short podcast, givin the power of a lot of the topics they touched on.  Given Ronalds life, this was somewhat expected, as he is defending some of the worst criminals and people, but Lex was not gentle.  But he pushes in a perfect way that makes for a good convo, and never makes Ronald uncomfortable.  For example the hernandez stuff, lex pushing on his suicide and sexuality and then asking ronald how he felt—wow.  But what a wild switch to ‘what books do you like?’  I was shocked.  Maybe something was edited out?  Still, lex was not scared or worried about anything here, and this made me a bit scared for how ronald would react, and ronald was extremely professional, honest, and cool about his responses.  This was a deep and interesting convo, and especially for those that are interested in hearing from the guilty and side that are generally frowned upon, this is your podcast.  But could make some people uncomfortable, and even made me a little at times.
