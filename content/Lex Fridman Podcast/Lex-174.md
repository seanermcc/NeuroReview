Tyler was chaulk full of solid, grounded economics and had a very nice opinionated mind that isnt often heard from academics. While he did say he leaned left, his discussion and ideas didn’t feel like it, and instead were open minded and very solid in truth and fact.  He was a bit nerdy, and a bit too egotistical about his own podcast and clubhouse for some reason, but not over the top.  This weirdly had a great flow to it that was almost unexpected given his voice and demeaner.  This was grounded in money and economics, but branched off into humanities and social sciences and psychology often, in a very nice and not too distracting way. Overall another solid economic related podcast.
