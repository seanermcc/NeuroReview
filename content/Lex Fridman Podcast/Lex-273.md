Chris was very well spoken and interesting and on the ground collecting data about violence—all really cool.  His stories provided a great angle to follow his ideas and theories into a really cool space, and the evolution of studying violence that he has been on is fascinating. I love lex’s focus on the scooter analogy and chris in danger—came up multiple times and at the end.  And this convo was kind of ironic regarding Israel and Palestine, given the conflict that comes in the future (listening to this in 2025). Having Chris on again to rediscuss this would be super valuable I think.  Chris didn’t have anything overly profound, but his consistency and focus on ideas in the space of violence and war and gangs was insightful and just straight up cool. Never too detailed or gory or hyper-focused, and they both kept a nice level of discussion.
