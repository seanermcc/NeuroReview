James was a really well spoken and cool guy, especially for a programmer.  The way that he was just so straight to the point, nice, and not really over-explaining any of the concepts or ideas he talked about, made for a great convo.  Biggest complaint was how short it was.  I had to relisten to the part where he talks about making java and why, because the answer just felt so silly.  But really it was, it just seemed to come from him traveling the world, seeing a bunch of flawed programming, and thinking of common sense solutions for the companies.  This then led him and his team to create the idea.  Really cool and simple story.  Lex was cute being so excited and humbled by James—its great when its someone who is so humble getting such hype.  Would highly recommend having on again!
