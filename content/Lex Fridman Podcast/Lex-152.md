Dan was not shy about his greatness, and had a huge ego. Lex fed into this as well, which I didn’t love.  Also, lex was cute at the beginning talking a lot—funny to see how he used to be as an interviewer. This had the bones of a high quality lex pod, but just was not quite executed to the fullest. Lex was too overly excited and referenced too much stuff, and Dan responded in a very egotistical way. I actually think this podcast should happen again and dive into more stories, psychology, and philosophy instead of specific moments and a wrestling only focus.
