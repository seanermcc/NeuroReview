Modi (as he calls himself) was such a cool guy, and vibed so well with lex.  I couldn’t even tell that there was a trasnlater!  Edited so well.  Modi was so compelling, and interesting, and passionate.  His stories wer e so great, and he told them so well, and lex kept asking great questions throughout.  There was a great balance of personal and big picture/world leader type discussion, and it didn’t get too political (although sadly it did a bit and it was pro trump).  A fantastic episode that would be great for anyon ewho cares about eastern culture, the world, politics, meaning, purpose, spritiuality, or life/death.
