I love these kind of conversations with artists and creatives, as lex really gets to the big points and the soul of them somehow.  I felt the same way with the convo with Dan Reynolds.  I ended up listening to oliver during this, and wow it was powerful.  Then the live song at the end hit even harder.  There is something so real and raw about hearing the mind and perspective of a creator and how they came up with the music, politics around it, fame, where they came from.  Such a beautiful perspective on music and creativity, and without asking the dull huberman like questions about creativity either.  Hearing about his depression, integrity to not gtake the money, and just vibe/story and then heraing his voice and music just made so much sense.  Seeing someone be themselves and so genuine is just so beautiful.
