So lex is super interested in Gavins creativity and poem writing---but this part of the convo was very cringe and weird.  First off, his poems werent necessarily good and lex acted like they were the best things ever.  Gavin was very humble about it, but was still awk.  And they then take up too much time on this nonsense which took away from the power and impact and convo about adobe and his work and his life story.  Let him talk about the poems and creativitiy if he wants, don’t force it on him like this lex.  The chats about Adobe and the future and AI were really cool, but overshadowed by the uncomfort brough at beginning and throughout from weird creativity and poetic nonsense.  I would love to have gavin on again longer for a redemption.
