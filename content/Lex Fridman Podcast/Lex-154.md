Really interesting perspective on testing experimentally religion—looking/asking about Christ/spiritual ideas on other planets and in other cultures.  And how this was something that got someone killed in the past.  And the way that Jews/Christians agree that the masiah will arrive in the future, and that we can ask him later.  He says ‘if theology puts skin in the game, it can be tested’.  Great attitude about religion. ‘A theory that cannot be falsified is not productive.’ Another great quote--’Knowledge should be a dialogue with nature, not a monologue’.  Overall, Avi is absolutely what you would think of when you think of astrophysicist, but is actually so cool and thoughtful and a real human being.  He was so good at refrencing others in history and the impacts they have made, while also not being too humble and discrediting himself.  He had great analogies, which my favorite was ‘eye on the ball’ (which I was told as a kid over and over when learning baseball).  A great lex podcast with a great guest.
