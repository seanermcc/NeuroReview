This conversation was very intense and enlightening.  Its really neat to hear someone so knowledgeable not just spit out the media rehtorick for covid--instead it feels true, honest, and scientific.  A much needed conversation during the era of Covid nonsense and misinformation.  Also, this was one of the first lex podcats i listened to, and i bought jamies book cus of it.  REally cool  convo
