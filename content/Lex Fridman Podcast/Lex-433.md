This convo was a bit redundent from previous convos with sarah (and lee).  Its nice to hear about the backlash and what the assembly theory nature paper was, but this was way way better in the last convo with lee.  The coolest part was when lex talks about this ayohausca trip and saragh says that’s what being a theor phys is always like, kind of profound.  And then their convo about fashion.  Language thing was ok, but feel like I've heard sarah talk about this before.  I feel like this would be a good place to start listening to sarah, but isnt necessarily her best with lex (although still good).
