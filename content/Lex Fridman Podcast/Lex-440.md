Pieter is one of the most classic, genuine, fun, interesting, computer scientists around.  He shares with us very great small parts of his story at many points, from the lowest (at beginning) to the highest (staying up all night hyped one of many projects), and goes through many of his projects with lex here.  My personal favorite was hoodmaps, especially looking into St. Louis (my hood), made me laugh a lot.  The simple and elegant approach of just identifying a problem and making something that helps fix it is very...refreshing.  Also his advice at end to just do what you're passionatie about and not listen to people is somewhat commonplace for many creatives and intersting peole on Lex, but Pieter really channels this energy and vibe really well.  A minimalist, a creative, and a fun nerdy guy.  A really good podcast that talked a lot about applications of AI that was much needed with a lot of more recent pop type podcasts.
