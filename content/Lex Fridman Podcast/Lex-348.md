This was an interesting podcasts--especially as it felt that lex often pushed back and was not afraid to be a bit combative with Nathalie, something I feel lex is often not enough of.  They do a bit of fun background about life and mars and aliens and fermi peridox for the first half, and then elegantly get into her story.  This felt natural, and while her story was great, it did drag on for a bit.  I feel ilke more of the science and purpose and big picture questions could have been infused here, but instead it made this feel a bit over the top and made her seem like she was talking about how great she is, and I don’t think that was what she wanted and indeed she is humble.  Basically it took almost an hour of talking about her free diving and volcanos to get to why she was there and what the science was.  So the question finally from lex 'what does the science say' was so great but took too long to get to.  Then in the big picture the podcast was too short considering how long that took.  Wanted more about aliens and how she got into that research and what she really has found especially beaty about life in volcanos.
