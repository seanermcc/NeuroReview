Peter is a really interesting voice in the realm of Comp sci.  Lex starts it by saying they will talk CS and philosophy, but it felt a little less like philosophy and more just like humanity.  Peter was able to jump back and forth from the big picture to a bit technical, but was very nice that he didn’t get too technical.  This was a really nice intro lecture into cs, and into the power and bigger idea of it.  But Peter does a nice dance around CS and the power and implication, while telling us how he’s used applications and how python works.  I feel lex asked great questions, and this was overall very enjoyable as a non CS expert.  Would recommend to anyone on the fringe of CS, or above.
