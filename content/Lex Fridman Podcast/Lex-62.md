Its so amazing to hear someone so wise, interesting, and impactful stutter… Im not sure if it’s a lisp or nerve, but man seeing someone like this as a human is so cool. The impact he's made on the field (which im not a part of) is felt in Lex's questions and awe, but you can just feel Donalds humility and humanity in his responses. A great breadth of topics were touched on here in only 2 hours, with a lot of emphasis on comp sci and his writing, but also to religion, music, death (classic lex), happiness, and god. This guy is what everyones grandpa should strive to be.  Cant wait to listen to episode 2--this is one of the better early lex pods.
