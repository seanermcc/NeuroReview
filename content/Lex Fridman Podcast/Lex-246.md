Peter, while definitely very smart, was incredibly boring and non-charismatic.  Had the hardest time holding my attnetion and interest.  I even listened to it twice.  He’s almost slower and less excited then lex, which I didn’t really realize is possible.  But they do discuss the current status of phsycis related ideas and if you’re into that stuff this might be interesting.  But this is not the pod I’d recommend about this topic, and maybe would recommend listening on 2x speed so you don’t fall asleep…
