Lex and Eric stayed away from physics, math, and geometric unity here, which was a nice difference compared to their other convos.  They discuss music for a while at the beginning, and Erics love for it and connection between math and music is powerful, and something I have also felt in my life.  Lex pushes eric hard on the fact that he hasn’t done podcasts in a while, and they discuss this in great detail.  A lot of insights come out, such as psychology of fear and putting yourself out there, and what its done to eric and his life. And this episode was around 2020 election when things were heating up, so that makes it even more interesting.  Nice to have a respectful and entertaining convo about this stuff that didn’t get hateful or too political.  Then they dive into the jeff epstein controversy and conspicuity, in a detail I’ve never heard before (or at least perspective).  This was also interesting, and overall this episode felt like a convo that was discussing things that usually are just unspoken in academic halls and institutions.  This makes it a great episode for an open minded scientist.
