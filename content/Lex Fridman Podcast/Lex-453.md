This podcast breaks open the world leader and presidential guests for Lex, and he does it elegantly. 2 hours with Javier was likely very difficult to make happen, and Lex does a great job of balancing hard hitting, political type questions and conversation with fun, humanistic conversation. Its really refreshing to see a politician like this as a human being, and I hope (and indeed does happen) that lex can do this with many more politicians in the future. The worst part was that 2 hours didn’t quite feel like enough.
