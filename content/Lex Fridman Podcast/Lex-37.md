I liked the style of ths conversation as lex acts a bit naïve but then gets into autonomous vehicles and ethical questions very elgantly.  However, vijay had to kind of make his own questions and take the conversation where he wanted, which made lex seem a bit softer than normal.  Also, was kind of short and vijay's story and impact in the field and in his company did not come out very well.
