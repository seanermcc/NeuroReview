Manolis is such a thoughtful, interesting, inspriing, and emotional guy.  Lex feeds right into this by asking him about music right away, and they end up going through like 10+ songs and talking about it for 30 mins.  This kind of thing could be a turnoff to a lot of people, and was a bit for me, but the 2nd time I listened to it after I had gotten to know both lex and manolis more it was better.  The middle has some nice juicy stuff about meaning and life and evolution and the brain.  And then at the end we get into some peoms, which was a bit weird.  Not great, but not too bad, and an interesting less sciency view of Manolis with this one.

    2nd comment (accidentaly made 2): This conversation was a bit too poetic, music focused, and weird to be really good.  Personally I like Manolis so I was kind of interested in most of it, but it was a bit too cringey and I think would be off-putting to most people, (hence the lower rating). This was nice and deep and interesting at times, it was just a bit weird and manolis was kind of flirtatious and too affectionate to make for an exciting conversation.  Needed a bit more science and mechanisms within the affection and cringeyness to make this a great podcast.
