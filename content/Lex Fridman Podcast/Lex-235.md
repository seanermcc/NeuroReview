This was some nice info and dialouge about rapid covid testing for the first half of it, something that was needed at the time of this podcast. However, it didn’t hit as hard as I would have thought, and felt very common sense.  Of course we should test and make that possible and easy.   Easier said then done.  I don’t think enough of the discussion was focused on how and why these things werent happening, and rather it just came across as hubrus against leaders and people who are passionate about one side of the vaccine/covid situation.  There was some nice depth of personality and character from michael in the second half, that I wish would have been longer.
