Saiffadon has a very charismatic, amusing, and convicted vibe that makes for a great long form conversation. He is very hateful about the fiat currency throughout, maybe rightfully so, but what was offputting about it and his character was the close mindedness.  Especially about kaynesean economics, where I didn’t feel the negatives were rightfully explained or pointed out. A really nice description of bitcoin, austiran economics, gold standards, what is money, was all well said and well described. But the negative and hateful rehtoric that lex does try to combot made this convo less productive and harder to trust saiffadon.  Also was a bit redundent at times.  The last hour he must have said ‘shitcoin’ 20+ times, and lex tries to push back and gets bullied out of his puhback.  This was frustrating as a listener, and the shitcoin rehtoric got old and was somewhat childish.  Overall, an incredible textbook like definition of economic ideas from a charismatic man, but with too much ego and not enough humility.
