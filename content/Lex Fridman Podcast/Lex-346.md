Ed is a really cool and interesting dude, but also dark, sad, and inspiring all in the same. Lex is always so good at these conversations about criminals and crime and death and murders and fear and darkness overall. Lex does a good job of ‘lifting up’ Ed throughout, even when he goes on a bit of tangents.  However, I felt a lot of the stories and ideas were in third person, and a bit more 1st person attitude and storytelling could have really boosted this already interesting conversation. For some reason, it just didn’t hit as hard as some of the other convos about these topics like Chris Tarbell, Roger Reaves, or Mathew Cox. Still a good episode overall, and worth a listen if you are interested in drugs and cartel and this kind of history/truth, but not the first one I’d choose for Lex’s crime series.
