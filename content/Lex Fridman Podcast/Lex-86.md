This was the best story, background, excitement passiona, and podcast I’ve seen lex do about alpha go/zero, which he mentions often.  I feel like ibe veen missing this since its brought up so much and I never really knew the details about Alpha Go.  But hearing David’s perspective and passion was so compelling and cool.  You love to see someone so nerdy be so real and loving and optomistic, while staying grounded in technicality and engineering. His ability to stay big picture and describe things and ideas was so great, where nothing was ever over my head at all in this episode. His discriptin of the meaning of life was so elegant and humble, where a lot of tech people just shrug off this question.  This is a great place to start or go to for an outsider of AI, and my biggest complaint was that it was too short.  Should definitely have on again and for longer!
