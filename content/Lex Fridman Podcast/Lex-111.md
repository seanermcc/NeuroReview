Richard is a really humble and interesting computer scientist. He really doesn’t come across near as theoretical as you might’ve thought and instead it’s kidn of his focus is algorithms and theres almost this magical riddle like nature of the algorithms that he really shows off well and emphasizes why he thinks he’s a great teacher/professor.  Richard is clearly a very nice person.  A very heartmwarming person insnt necessarily the most enthusiastic or someone who you would think to be a strong leader, but definitely is the guy you’d want cleaning your mission and figuring out what’s going on.  He really makes the theoretical nature of Peter science not so hard for someone outside the field to understand and this is really refreshing in this field and walk us through a handful of fun algorithms in a really nice way and that’s a lot of good questions about it.  Lex  got a little bit weird with some random questions but mainly want to stay focused on algorithms , especially for someone who really likes science and data and wants to ujnderstand algorithms.  Richard is the kind of person youd want to learn from and get interested into CS through, but still too niche to have a high rating.
