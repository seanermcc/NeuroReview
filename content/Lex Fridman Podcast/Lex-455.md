This dude should be the voice of alien science. Without looking at him he’s got such a powerful sound and enthusiasm about his stuff, balances lex so well. This convo just kept getting better and better, starting off into aliens and a ton of awesome details about studying them and what it looks like.  Then it evolved into a more biological/human oriented discussion on life and search for life.  Then a casual and nice shift into philosphy, science and religion, and franks emphasis on agency as a fundamental idea. His books were not marketed, but naturally referenced throughout, and his papers and references to other scienctists was so natural.  The perfect balance between his own ideas and referencing others, where hes very humble but still has a ton of confidence and passion and his own ideas.  For anyone interested in this kind of stuff (aliens, physics, space travel, philosophy, religion, origin of life), this is a great convo.
