Brian is such a chill, neat, excited, cute, fun, and humble old guy. He elegantly told the stories of how he was involved in the initial phases of programming and creation of linex.  Love the way he describes his collaborations and work.  His voice and vibe are just so gentle, but what he talks about is so powerful, that it makes for a beautifully paradoxical combination. My biggest complaint is that it wasn’t long enough--I would have loved another 30-45 mins of philosophical/big picture discussion with Brian.
