Chamath is somewhat interesting, but comes off with a little bit of an ego for some reason to me at points.  He talks about being very opinionated but with an open mind, but it sometimes feels he’s too opinionated.  Even with that said, he’s a very interesting person with an intersting backstory and life and advice for people.  He says it clearly and directly and doesn’t sugarcoat the hard or bad parts.  Getting the perspective of an insider at facebook, but who isnt also ‘famous’, is interesting, and talking about money and game theory and energy are all interesting.  But stil lthere was a bit of pompousness in the air that I felt lex fed into that I didn’t like—for example hyping up their podcast.  ‘You should stop lsitening to this and listen to the all in pod’--chamath should have commented no, but instead was like ‘yea cool’.
