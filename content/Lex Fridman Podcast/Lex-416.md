Fun, but also serious conversation about the power and limits and future of AI.  It was never too technical, nor too deep philosophically, so it was constantly easy to follow and interesting.  Yann is a good guest and vibes well with lex, and is one of the classic CS guys but doesn’t give off the overly nerdy/technical vibe.  Wish I could hear more of his personal story.
