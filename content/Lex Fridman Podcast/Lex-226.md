This is a cool convo about teaching and how to teach math (which jo calls it maths’). There is some great nuance and excitement for maths without getting to technical and mathy throughout. A great teaching, professor, and mentorship pod about what it means to teach and mentor, and why you would do it, and why it is necessary.  Jo is very sweet and compassionate while also powerful and interesting to listen to.  Good for anyone interested in teaching or math(s).
