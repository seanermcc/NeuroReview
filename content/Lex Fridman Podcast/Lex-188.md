pod_notes: 'Vitalik is a gool person and force in the bitcoin/CS world, but he''s
  tough to interview and converse with. He has deep stuff underlying him but it gets
  hidden behind his nerdyness. I think you did your best with this, and it wasn’t
  necessarily a bad conversation, but compared to other ''bitcoin bro'' convso, this
  just wasnt quite up to snuff; not deeb or wide enough.  Maybe he will be redeemed
  in episode #2? '
