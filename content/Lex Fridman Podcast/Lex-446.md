Ancient american history is so cool every time I hear about it, and eds perspective is so warm, nice, fun, and enlightening. Lex is like a kid in a candy store asking questions and learning (as I did as a listener) about the history of these american civilizations. As someone who got into grahm hancock the past few years, bringing him up in the way they did was great--not mean or rude, but honest and scientific.  The way debates and contentions should be held. Would be an awesome collab/debate.  But the fact ed never skipped a beat, knew so much about history and his job, you could just feel his passion and love for his job and for archaeology and for history.  And the lack of the plug until the very end for his pod was perfect--humble and kind like ed.  A top pod with a low profile guest as of late.
