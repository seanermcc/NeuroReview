This convo started off rough and was hard to follow for the majority of people I feel.  But then, towards the end, lex asked about his son, and shit got real. His son was killed by al quaeda about 20 years ago. It was strange how not upset and emotional Judea was about the whole thing, and just stated it like a fact. But this part of the discussion still hit hard and turned it into a more profound direction, and frankly saved this podcast from an even worse rating. Lex looped it back to reasoning and causation and it really tied a knot an a really poorly packaged, awkward, terrible voice of a conversation. This guy is your classic Jewish grandpa.
