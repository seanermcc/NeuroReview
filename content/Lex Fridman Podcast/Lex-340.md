Chris is an awesome person, and really shows the humanity and reality of someone who works for the government and FBI.  Sometimes these organizations feel so inhuman and fishy or corrupt, but seeing just such a normal and cool dude be a big time agent is super neat.  He went through a lot tracking down these guys, and lex elegantly goes back and forth from emotional to techincal to psychological aspects of Chris’s journey through the Silk Road, anonymous, and taking down these cybercriminals. Got him to cry at the end—had a little foreshadowing of this at beginning which was neat.
