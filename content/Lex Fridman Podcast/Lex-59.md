Sebastian was awesome, he’s straight up on a mission (and believes it is possible) to make flying cars a reality, and something that are widely used.  His passion and love and mentorship and ingenuity all came out elegently over a short podcast, which is hard to do. Additionally, his path through academia and industry was nicely touched on, and lex and sebastian did a great dance of philosophy and fun with technical and practical ideas.  This is one of the best pods about cars/driving/autonomous vehicles, which lex has a lot of, and the biggest issue is the length which left a few topics shallow.  For example lex didn’t even get to ask about books, but even with that steven pinkers book gets brought up naturally by sebastian.  Would have loved more advice and big picture idea thinking from him.  Please have on again!!
