This convo just hit weird--at one point when they are talking about his commercial, where they call him a genious, and he doesn’t really act humble and is very weird about the whole thing and they talk way too much about it.  This was a microcosum of the entire convo--too detailed on weird/intricate stuff, and not very fun, interesting, or relatable.  A good guest, but a not very well exectued convo.  For example lex asks about books, and he kind of says he doesn’t read books and then makes it weird and beats around the question.  More focused on what he knows, and getting good ideas out of him and thoughts, would have been much better here.  Maybe try to have on again to 'redeem' both of you guys...
