This conversation was right in lex’s wheelehouse--a russian guy whose working on self-driving cars. I was impressed at the lack of focus on lex and his experiences with self driving research and instead the focus on waymo and dimitri. He was a bit conceited and selfish about how great it was, where there was little to no talk about issues.  Made it feel like maybe together they were blidned by the excitement of the technology. It was nice that the fact they were both russian and their bond didn’t come up til later, so the convo stayed focused on the main topic for the majority. Self driving is interesting and a future of it happening at a large scale is cool to think about. Overall, this conversation is a bit technical and sad that dimitri couldn’t share a lot of the stuff he takled about because of IP, but beside s that there was great flow and information and an excited Lex, which is always nice.
