This is a good convo that touches on many topics from computer science to biology with a genetics focus, and was almost great except for manolis had a bit of an ego (somewhat suprisingly). He hyped up his onw projects and ideas too much and other not enough. But besides this, it was a really fun, deep, and interesting convo. Loved manolis’ balance of the importance and usage of AI but with fucs and necessity for it to have an impact on biology. They very lightly tapped on covid, language, and some other fun ideas that they do in future podcasts in more detail.  Not where I would suggest someone to start with Lex/Manolis, but still ok and worth the listen especially for biological scientists.
