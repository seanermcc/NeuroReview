This is likely a bit over anyones head who isnt big on computer science, and only gets fun at the end with a few bit picture questions. Future conversations with him are much better (and really glad they happened because of how short this one was), as he is an interesting guy but comes off as super nerdy on this episode.  Its interesting for someone to think about how to make things different or new, and go from one big place to another in your career.  But a bit too specific on some of the CS details for a broad audience.
