This podcast was nice and timely, given the covid outbreak and the pandemic being so active at this time in April 2020. I wish I would have listened to this back when Covid was in full force (I listened in April 2025). There was a nice balance of biology and mechanisms and protein/viral structure with bigger picture impact of these ideas. They navigated nicely to transfection and an AI generated model for it on a cruise ship.  Lex and Dmitry vibed so well, especially with their Russian roots, and this made for a nice, non political, nuanced conversation about the details of covid and vaccines. The gentleness of the mask discussion was a nice touch.
