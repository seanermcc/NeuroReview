This conversation was just too short, especially given the vsauce is a content creator and this is litearlly content for him.  The convo was solid, and had a handful of great questions, but that’s all they were able to get into.  So really this felt like such a tease.  It was getting somewhat profound at times, but the topic would shift and then it just ended. TRY TO HAVE ON AGAIN?!
