Dawn’s energy (and laugh) was contagious, and she was really fun. It made for a somewhat paradoxical conversation, because it was set in darkness and AI hacking. They stuck to technicalities for the first half, which was a bit hard to follow for me but likely cool for someone more into AI stuff. But then the back half balanced things out as it got more personal and interesting and full of stories. I thought they vibed really well and that this was a nice early podcast, long and deep and also broad. Interesting perspective on hacking and future of AI and safety, and even China vs. US.
