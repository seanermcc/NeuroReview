Another solid episode with Monolis—you guys have great chemistry. But this wasn’t the best, it felt a bit shorter and not as broad as some of the previous ones.  I felt like you guys were discussing the idea of incorperating AI into life and science and reality for a really long time, which is totally fine, but it got a little redundent at times.  Still, seeing your friendship grow in front of our eyes is super cool, and the softness and beaty of manolis is really shown here, even moreso than in previous episodes with him.
