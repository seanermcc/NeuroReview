Lmao the drunk intro was actually great, so many cuts haha. The rain on the roof wasn’t even that bad, but lex was sweating or something and the background behind lex was also a bit weird.  But even moreso, the conversation was pretty weird for some reason, felt a bit off.  Hard to follow, the usual exciting questions were answered so non-directly that I was having a hard time staying attentive.  I had to go back a few times on multiple points and still didn’t get them.  I wish lex would have slowed scott down a few times and asked some simpler questions.
