So this was very timely and informative and helpful for anyone who cares a bit about the iran/isreal conflict.  But the way the debate kinda unfolded was cringy at times, where Scott was overly interuptive, then got sensitive when mark interuppted, and then he was kind of making fun of scott for being an immagrint, so lex had to step in.  This behavior felt kind of childness, and is not good for a quality conversation/podcast.  But evn with this huge negative, the value of the episode and also seeing how these topics can make people so sensitive is helpful as an american.  And as someone who likes to have interesting and broad conversations.  So this has a lot of good in it, with a small amount of cringe/annying.  But great details on nukes in general, iran in general, and the intersection of the two ideas which takes us through history and politics and geo politics and religion.  All good and interesting stuff from two world experts.
