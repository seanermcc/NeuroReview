This was one of those episodes that while being 2 hours, felt a lot shorter then that and I wish would have been longer.  Brian is such a good communicator (especially relative to most physicists) and keeps thinks above the surface for the most part, allowing anyone to understand the ideas they discuss.  The balance and dance between theory and experimental was really nice in this conversation, and especially insterseting when they discuss the nobel prize for string theory.  Some more specific stories about brian and his life and journey would have been great, but instead this just focuses on some of the biggest ideas in physics and life and the mind.  A really nice intro conversation for someone on physics, that my biggest compaint is the length.  Should have on again!
