A very profound episode, considering world events. And the fact that we know Omar already and Lex/Omar have a relationship boosts the impact of this convo. Yes, this was good after shaprio and destiny in light of gaza/middle east, but moreso this was great in the bigger arc of Netanyahu, El-Kurd, and Harari who you had on months ago.  Omar is INCREDIBLY well spoken and speaks of hatred and violence and suffering with an unsettling calmness. Lex spends the perfect amount of time questioning on gaza and the situation and gives some perspective on religion and the bigger picture towards the end, which was a great balance for this podcast. And the political and sillier issues are only touched on briefly.  The connections between ukraine, the civil rights movement (malcom X and MLK) was great, as well as the brief holocost connection. I get the feeling from this convo more than any other 'hard hitting' lex podcast that this is history that is being written and we are all living through it.
