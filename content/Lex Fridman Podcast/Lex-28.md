These are things that you want from an autopilot or self driving car system. Chris is a really nice voice in this space, as his speaking an attitute are very calm and composed which gives me a good feeling about the future of this kind of technology. Lex asks a number of fun questions along with hard hitting ones in this short podcast, but they didn’t have enough time to dive very deep into a lot of the ideas.  Chris also has a really cool background that was just brushed on, would be good to HAVE ON AGAIN potentially in future.
