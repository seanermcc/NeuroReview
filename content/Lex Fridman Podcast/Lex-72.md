So quantum computing just makes no sense to me.  I felt like I heard the word ‘Q-bits’ 150 times and got hardly nothing else out of this conversation besides the fact that I don’t understand the quantum world.  But I also feel like sometimes this is the point—its so theoretical and confusing and difficult to understand that its hard to make application and use and explain. So that’s why you need guys like scott looking into it.  He’s cute, definitely, and maybe better than some others at explainging this stuff, but it just didn’t get through to me even after listening 2x to many parts.  Beginning felt a bit rambly about how philosophy and science work together too.  Not enough stories or things we can all relate to to be interesting to a wide audience.
