Nick makes a great argument for simulation theory--and gives it really interesting scientific insight and perspective.  They do this for an hour or more, and really consider the implications and what it would mean and often get a little philosophical and even religious in a weird fun sciency way.  Nick is a super nerd, and really embodies it.  I love the cofidence in his voice and attitute.  I feel more broad conversation, with his background and come up in science and how he foundt his field, would be super great.  This was a bit short and a bit too hyper focused on simulation.  More on conciousness, what that means, and philosophy would be cool.
