This was one of the best judo pods I’ve heard not being a judo person (out of lex’s judo pods). A lot of big picture cool ideas with a gentle dive into judo, using it more as an example for how archetypes or ideas are manifested rather then the main focus of the convo or ideas.  We really got to see who john was in this episoe.  I think this episdoe should be watched first before any of the other judo pods, especially with john or his team to get a good context of who john is as a human.  Then this will make those more interesting and you will see the impact and power of Johns coaching and ideas through the way they manifest in others.
