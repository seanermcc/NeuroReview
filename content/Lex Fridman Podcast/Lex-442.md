So lex finally had trump on--felt like this has been coming for a little while (still waiting for Putin) and I was really excited to get into this when I first saw it.  The resounding message from the audience here is that more of this 'long form' conversation needs to be had with politicians and I 100% agree.  But still this is much too short, and seemingly too edited for a traditional lex episode.  I do really appreciate the message from lex at the end about the difficulties of having politicians and world leaders on.  But either way, when you do more in the future hopefully it can be longer.  Trump basically dodges and doesn’t answer directly any of the questions, but still gives a better interview then I've ever seen from him (not seen many tbh).  Needed much more from him and hope to see trump on again, maybe in a debate form in the future??
