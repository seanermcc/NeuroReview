This was a pretty good conversation, just a bit too short and kinda felt like there was an ulterior motive present that comes up at the end where Stephen is inesting in the MIT computer science program/future.  I do think this initial convo opened some doors for some future rich/powerful people to come on, so that’s a huge plus, but it wasn’t handled with the same amount of care as lex does in the future with other CEO’s or leaders.
