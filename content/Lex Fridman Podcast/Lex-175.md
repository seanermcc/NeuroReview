Another great comedian conversation with lex.  A great balance of passion, history, and humor. Lex was cute trying to be funny, and actually it felt yannis was too much at times but that kept them balanced. A bit too much into his own podcast and the history of hyennas, which was driven by lex, but lex was following his own interest so it made sense. I would have liked some more of his own backstory and personal life, which was only touched on at the very end.
