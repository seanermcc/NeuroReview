Lex conversing with these uber rich guys really shows their humanity, something that is lacking in any other media form.  We really see the true influence that money has on them and their lifes, and its suprisingly little. For one of the first times every hearing Jeff speak like this publicly, it makes a lot of sense how he is so successful.  The dude is a revolutionary and sees so much of how things work from every aspect, from the design/engineering to the people making it and all the way to the people using it.  Hearing jeff talk and think about interplanetary travel is awe inspiring in the same way listening to Elon is, and this kind of thinking should inspire people everywhere to think beyond.  Meaning exists in the things that we want if we don’t exist, and these two guys, who seem to have 'everything', are creating a deeper meaning and purpose that could last for centuries and millennia to come.
