This episode was a bit after the peak of the Covid pandemic, and putting it in context of the time the vaccine discussion was most important here.  Lex and Vincent have a nice, safe, and science backed discussion about vaccines and wheather they are good or bad with a lot of details.  This was important at the time, and years later doesn’t quite hit as hard as it did then.  But the science and mechanism and beauty of viruses that vincent describes, and lex probes into very well, make for an interesting discussion overall. This is one of the top COVID specific conversations lex had, and was somewhat daring at the time, and was cool that it got so detailed and nuanced with multiple topics related to COVID, including virus biology, mRNA vs DNA, vaccines/treatments, and testing.
