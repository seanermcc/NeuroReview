A cool conversation about universal agi, and this angle towards a common sense or emotional intelligence of AI that is rarely discussed.  But sad to hear how much behind a paywall and corporate this company and their ideas are.  Douglas was an interesting guy, and anyone interested in AI should most definitely listen to this to hear a new/diff perspective on it.  But Lex only did a minor pushback on the lack of openness, and I felt he could have pushed much harder on this point given his vision.
