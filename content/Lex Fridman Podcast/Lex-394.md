This conversation was so dynamic, the editing and videos were incredible, and there was so much chemistry and excitement between Lex and Neri.  The passion behind her mission--through excitement, curiousity, and confidence, just bled through Neri here and Lex only helped to narrow her thoughts into a beautiful direction.  Amazing conversation.
