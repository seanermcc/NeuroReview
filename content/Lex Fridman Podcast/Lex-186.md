Lex and Bryan come out hot with some helmets that read your brain--Bryans part of a company that makes Brain computer interface (BCI) technology.  They discuss this for a while in a pretty good way, but it didn’t really hold/capture my attention as well as other podcasts.  Maybe because it felt a bit like a pitch or sell since they used them at the beginning.  And they didn’t do great at explaining the basics and the story of the kernel helmet.  So I guess it felt like a bit of a plug without the nice story/flow/deep/simple questions from lex.  But later on this pod gets back into the story and some touchy subjets and deep aspects of bryans human nature that really saves this aspect of it.  And low BMI because they both fast, and the fasting component of bryans life is psychological and interesting, similar to lex's.
