I'm a neuroscientist, so this theoretically should be really interesting to me.  I've also listened to this 1 time through before, and when relistening had to listen to many parts over again. I had a difficult time following Karl and Lex together, especially when the dive into the Free energy principle which is the bulk of this podcast and Karls work.  More of a story would have been much better here to keep listener engaged.  Also, simplifying some of the ideas, asking dumb and straightforward questions from lex, and slowing Karl down when it comes to the signifigance of the free energy principle; what does it mean? What are its implications?.  This would have made this podcast way easier to follow and more engaging.  

But with all this said, there were some great points here and some profound statements, especailly regarding moving to change things in the world, the power of neuroimaging (and constraints), and Karls fascination with heirarchical structure (but that part too would be easy to go over your head).  Would love another, longer, more nuance, and story packed episode with Karl in the Future.
