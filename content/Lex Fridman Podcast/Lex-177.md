Rista is a great thinker, a computationl evolutaionary biologist (I think self proclaimed?  Or lex said it).  But with that title, he didn’t get too deep or nerdy about things, which seems rare for this kind of topic. He spoke with a lot of concienciousness and passion that was very engaging and made for a nice podcast. Felt very natural throughout. Good stuff on complexity, reinforcement learning, animals and evolution, robots, and lex passion for these things. I think it could have been longer and gotten more into some of the studies and science, and what it actually means to be a computational evolutionary biologist.
