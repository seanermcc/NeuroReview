This was somewhat interesting, but not a debate at all. Lex didn’t push back enough an di felt they just constantly found common ground.  What even are the sisues that make the climate stuff debatable? Lets dive more into this.  Lots of good stuff on climate and journalism and social media and culture, but misleading and not what I thought it was going to be so somewhat disappointing.
