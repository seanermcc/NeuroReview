This conversation felt good and ok, but was just way too short considering the topic.  Lex and Keyu jived ok, but it never got too deep (never very personal or with many stories), and didn’t feel like it touched on very many topics about china.  For example the end lex jumped to like 3 or 4 good/deep questions that felt cutoff/short, likely due to time.  Didn’t even get to the meaning of life question.  What would the meaning of life for chinese people be?  What about religion?  Purpose?  Science?  Engineering? Coding?  So much stuff could have been hit on much harder here, and instead it was just an overfocus on tariffs, 1 child policy (which was cool detail actually), and economy.  Sure, some really interesting stuff there, especially the Mayor like situation that goes on, but not enough detail and not enough topics.  I was left wanting way more.
