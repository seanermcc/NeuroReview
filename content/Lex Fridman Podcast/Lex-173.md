Nick is a elegant speaker and writer in the realm of economics and money, and I love the breadth and depth of this kind of conversation. The philosophy of bitcoin and money and the ipact across time and civilizations is deep and profound, and you two touch alot of great points throughout this convo.  Honestly felt like 2.5 hours was short here and you could have gotten deeper and more philosophical at a number of times.
