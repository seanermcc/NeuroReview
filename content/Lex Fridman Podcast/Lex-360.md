Tim does a great job of expressing somewhat controversial or confusing ideas with easy/simple charts or statements.  Feels like that vibe is the vibe of his new book that lex references a ton (annoying, feels like a plug).  But on the topics of freedom of speech, wokeness, social justice, political parties—all things that are kinda just understood as how they are, was good to go into details and actually hear people discussing this somewhat normally.
