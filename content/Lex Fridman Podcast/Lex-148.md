Charles and Michael are friends, and teach an online course together, so they have some chemistry in this discussion.  It was interesting to see lex so timid and new to the 'debate' style interview, as this was his first.  A few times he interuppted at bad times and it also seemed like he was very tense/shakey (was bouncing his knee and swaying way more than normal).  So feel lex was just a bit nervous and off his game.  But Ccharles and Mike did their best to be 'fun' professors, and explain this in a number of ways.  They hardly get bogged down into the computer science stuff, and instead discuss more about passion and loving work and teaching and have a lengthy discussion on the state of college with covid.  All interesting, but given lex's problems and just the way Charles an dMIke are, couldn’t rate over 7.  Would say this is a must listen for a comp sci grad student or someone potentially wanting to do that.
