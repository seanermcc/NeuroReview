At the time of this podcast, it was obviously a huge deal for lex.  To have such a small podcast and audience and have someone with elons stature on as episode 18 was amazing.  And Lex handled this pressure great. Lex did a nice intro about how the conversation itself happened, and how he isnt biased in his questions, which I believe after watching him now for 1000+ hours. The go into some nice detail about the Tesla autopilot system, self driving, perception, and it felt very nuanced and detailed for only being a 30 minute conversation. Elon was quick and to the point with a lot of his responses, and lex worked around this well and continue to ask great questions throughout. Elon was a bit arrogant about how great tesla was, and aabout AGI and the future, but that’s just his vibe. It’s a interesting bled of optomism, ego, and futurism. This conversation was a niched episode with elon on autopilot (Tesla AI), was too short, but still good especially if you want to hear Elons perspective on self driving specifically.
