Oriol is a super (cool) nerd, who is the mind, body, and soul behind 'AlphaStar', which is an AI deep mind technology that beat master level players in the strategy game, StarCraft.  He goes very elegantly and detailed into how this happened, why this happened, and gets really deep into the theory of this kind of game and how the traning of AlphaStar worked.  I really enjoyed this convo as a non AI experect, as Oriol and Lex never got too deep into the weeds and instead all topics were relatively big picture and at the level of someone who plays video games, not necessarly someone who makes/programs them.  There is a nice dance into some of the story and life of Oriol in his work and schooling that is very natural in this convo, and not too much time was spent on this which was nice because it didn’t feel like Oriol's style.  My biggest issue here is that they didn’t really talk about anything else except starcraft, only a tiny bit of 'AGI' at the end, but hearing more about Oriol's story and life would be great (and happens in a future episode, yay!).  This is a great, early lex podcast.
