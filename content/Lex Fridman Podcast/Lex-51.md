This was a cool and quick insight into space travel, from the point of a person who makes a lot of the big decisions. I wanted much more, as it was too short. This had some nice ecitement and passion from a pro space explorer, who is on the cutting edge of space technology, that almost feld childlike at some points.  But this was in a good way, as its kind of neat to see that the explorers mind isnt much different from back in magellins day.  Its cool to see that someone like dava, a super professional ‘space explorer’, still lets her curiousity and excitement drive her to do crazy awesome technical stuff.
