They must have said the phrase ‘smart contracts’ 100+ times in this convo, and I felt it was never really explained basically enough.  Sergey used the idea of oracle networks and blockchains and nodes to talk about SCs, but never really explained the basics of these. But I do think I got the gist: that these Scs and online systems, i.e. oracles, are middlement for contracts that can look at both parties data and make the contract objective.  This is key for the trust dynamics between contracts ,and could revolutionize how any contract is made.  I think some discussion on contract law and what a contract is would be warranted.  But they staied pretty big picture, sergey was a great and engaging speaker, and lex asked a lot of good quesionts.  Overall pretty good, but just not enough basics.
