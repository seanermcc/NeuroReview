This conversation was a fantastic deep dive into the warring conflicts in ukraine and israel.  Douglas gives a very nice emotional perspective from within the war, having traveled to both regions and interacted with many soliders.  For me, this was the first highly descriptive and nuanced perspective for justifying israel’s war against palestine.  An interesting side note--I discussed this with some colleagues in academia afterwords, and when mentioning this perspective, they were very defensive and disagreed with this side and opinion.  But I kept an open mind and ended thinking that there is a lot of hatred and perspectives on war in general, and that nuanced discussions are the only way to hear the reality of the situation.  In total, I felt that all aggression and hatred against one another was wrong, and that peace and grace and forgiveness is the only way out.  For the ukraine/russia discussion, this hit really hard given Lex’s convo with zilensky, which was discussed, and trumps current political games going on there.  And Lex asserted most confidently his future discussion with Putin. LFG!  A good convo for anyone interested in the nuances of war, especially in todays political climate.
