Theres something so awesome about a british dude talking about evolution and humanity and history/evolution.  This guy reminds me a lot of a richard dawkins, but a little less dramatic or intesne about his opinions. But there was a great back and forth here from lex thinking about humans and our evolution, where violence fits in, and what really is a human. Some awesome quotes throughout, one of my favorite is that fire was the greatest 'invention' in human history. Another exciting idea is how monkeys are actively evolving, wehre some have more interesting and advanced behaviors than others. It seems that the reality of how special/different we are from primates is a lot less in the eyes of an anthropologist and experts than what most people would think or believe.
