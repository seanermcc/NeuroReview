Dimitra and Lex vibe great, with the strong russia and and AI vibes. And lex’s lack of expertise in biology and virology actually make all of his questions simplify dimitris thoughts and ideas to a perfect level, even for someone who knows biology (a bit at least). The initial discussion on protein domains, and how these are potentially the smallest unit of complexity in life, I felt was profound. Additionally, even as a russian you can feel dimitri’s passion and excitement for science.  The back half was a nice discussion on the power of AI and its application for biology, and the right amount of discussion on the virus at the time this was aired. The russian poem they read at the end was weird, and I don’t love asking someone like this about books.  Rather about mentors would be nice. So a good start, solid middle, and bad end.
