Cal is an interesting thinking/person from MIT--a classic MIT person actually.  Kind of an ouspoken version of lex.  He knows his stuff pretty well when it comes to comp sci and software, and does some nice analogies in that space--my favorite being the idea on religion at the end where he thinks through some of his thoughts on how religions are all operating systems to help people get a good/happy/holy spirit feeling.  I do feel he isnt very humble, and doesn’t reference many other scientists.  Talks about his book a decent amount, but that’s ok.  But this compared to hubermans pod with him I thought was much better--they don’t talk as much about Cal's book and its not as much talking like he's so great.  His ideas on productivity, social media, and emails (which was hit on great) are intersting and huge things that need to be talked about.  A good podcast and helpful for anyone who wants to be a productive person.
