Robert is the classic producer, and gives off rick ruben vibes (but maybe a family man version). The biggest bias and issue I have with this episode is I don’t really know hardly any of the movies he’s produced, except spy kids and I hardly remember that, so I don’t have the perpsective that lex does which is that this guy is an awesome producer of great movies.  But he definitely has an amazing mindset and perspective on life and creativity, and they discuss this elegantly for almost half of the podcast.  The rest was just a bunch of awesome stories about filmmaking and how he went about it.  Lex does a great job with all creative types and especially film makers, and this was another example of a solid lex pod getting into the depths of someones creative mind.
