This was a bit short and surface level compared to most lex podcasts, and that was partly because when lex asked deeper or interesting questions stephen just dodged them and said he doesn’t deserve to answer them...this was annoying. This mad lex then reask a lot of questions which was good but took away from stephen as a person. They didn  really talk about the books enough, where lex set it up like it was a big thing in his life (reading stevens books) but didn’t talk about it with him. Then lex quoting steven at the end I didn’t like, stay humble.  Some ideas were ok and I liked his take on mysticism, creativity, and war (kinda) but I wanted more discussion on war and mortality and stevens life.
