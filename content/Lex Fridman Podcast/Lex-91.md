This is an old lex podcast, so he's still a bit new.  But for having such a big name as Jack on, only having 50mins of a pod with such softball and simple questions was so Non-Lex like.  Was lex nervous?  When he asked questions he seemed to ramble and almost try to suggest answers for Jack before he would let him speak. Plus lex spent a good minute or two telling jack what they would talk about--just start talking lex!  You do it to every other guest and it’s a classic Lex pod tactic.  And then they don’t talk about twitter AT ALL!  Lex, you NEED TO HAVE JACK ON AGAIN PLEASE!!!!  Reedem yourself and Jack's light on your pod!!

    Lex had just had some 3+ hour podcasts recently though, so no excuse that this is so short!
