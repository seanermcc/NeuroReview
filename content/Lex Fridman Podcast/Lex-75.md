Marcus was a very well spoken, confident, and meaning-filled guy who spoke with a refreshing conviction about both technical and philosophical ideas. He was concise and elegant, and it made for a nice discussion that was often a bit shallow because of the vrevity of some topics.  Be he often had a zinger type of vibe that was somewhat profound, and lex would just respond with: ‘damn that was brilliant’.  That energy left me wanting more discussion on many of the points, as well as much much more regarding marcus’ story and what exactly AIXI is, the history behind it, and its relationship to deep mind.  Would love to see on again!
