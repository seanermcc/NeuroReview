Another immediate interuption from lex after 1st question--not a good way to start.  Lets hear what grant has to say.  Infinity question lex--what was that?  You answer your own question about it, don’t let grant answer, your answer was bad, then he says be clear on terminology.  Bad bad question and dumb. Grant is really interesting, lex is supper hyped up about him and acts like he's the best thing since sliced bread.  But grant somehow responds with humility.  For many of the questions, grant is almost stunned and answers sarcastically at first.  Would have liked much better questions and more of letting grant talk.  Some of his story about 3Blue1brown would have been great, and thank goodness you have him on again later.
