This episoe did not hit has hard as the other EW episodes, where his ego really came out a lot. Indeed, a lex points out, he talks way over our head about geometric unity and even when lex asks for a simple description its still super complicated.  To be honest, this was the 5th or so time I’ve listened to Eric talk about geometric unity, and I still don’t get the big idea. With that said, the story of Eric’s journey is told well and is very interesting, and he gets very opinionated at times and even hateful towards academia.  I felt that Eric’s justification for the whole system being flawed was based on one ‘secret meeting’ that enough details about the whole thing were not discussed for a listener to agree that Eric’s hatred was justifed. To me it seems like this was one example of a few faculty who may have been bad actors, but not an underlying system failure. More discussion on this is necessary I feel. In the end, this is worth a listen for an academic or someone into crazy.wild/passionate theories, or who likes EW, but not the EW pod I’d start with.  Or listen to this on 1.5x, as it is a bit long.  But appreciate the length given how early on this was in the Lex pod.
