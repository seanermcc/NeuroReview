Vitalik is definitely the kind of guy you want doing something like etherium—he knows his stuff so well, is a bit of a nerd, and is bold and willing to take risks.  But he’s a bit too nerdy for my liking and to make a super entertaining podcast, and instead stays focused on the technical side with most of his talking points and discussion. Lex taks him into some bigger ideas, and he is not quite as enticing or interesting there, which is probably a good thing for someone who is the CEO of a cryptocurrency.  They discuss some nice basics of therium and blockchain and are only a little over my head at times. I appreciated the ending, with Vitalik’s story about meeting putin and death, and wanted lex to push more into those topics. This podcast is a good place to go if you are into bitcoin and want to see/feel the face of a real bigtime creator.  But, I would not recommend this as a start or intro into bitcoin, considering lex’s future guests.  Would want to have on again and discuss things more philosophically, like ‘what is money’ and ‘how can blockchain change the future/government’.
