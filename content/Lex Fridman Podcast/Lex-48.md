I am certainly biased here as this was another programming languages guy, and that is one of my passions, but it was great to just hear his story and a little bit about the history of C++ and what it means for programming languages to be standardized. I loved the general philosophical discussion of programming language creation, where he emphasizes it’s about the principles of the programming language and not so much the features. He makes a great case for why it’s actually good for there to be some errors in implementation as long as you are prioritizing clarity of intent. In other words - it’s much more important for code to clearly indicate its intent than it is for that code to be entirely robust & functional. Over time, necessary refactorings and maintenance of code prioritizes the clarity of the code and not necessarily the elegance/creativity of the solution.
