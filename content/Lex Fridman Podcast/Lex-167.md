Given the timing of this podcast originally, I think it was probably more of a shock to Lex’s listeners given the lack of political people on prior to Saager.  This is a great ice breaker into Lex style and mindset of policits, and they do a nice deep dive into a handful of ideas with a good graspe on historical context.  From trump, to putin, to American freedom, to Saagers own story, this was a really nice intro to Saager, and a great prequil to his second podcast years later which I think is much more profound.  But this is a good place to start to gently get into politics with lex.
