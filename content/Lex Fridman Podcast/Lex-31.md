Good-ish, but a little tough to get past his arrogance. Perhaps that arrogance is justified as he’s obviously able to be a crazy fast and skilled problem solver - but there still is this sense of arrogance that makes it a little more challenging to fully respect his opinions/thoughts. I enjoyed the hacking perspective of “just throw everything at the wall and see what works” - but it’s a different style than I typically program with (and I sympathize with Lex’s take here as well in that both are valid and it just depends on the person). I think there may have been points when the arrogance almost irked Lex and he couldn’t get a practical answer to a question, but Hotz was a character worth listening to at least.
