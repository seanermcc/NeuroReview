Lex nad chris have a fun quirky vibe together that is interesting, and seeing/hearling lex light up at the intersection of physics/space/science/biology is super cool, and I felt the same way hearing chris talk.  Chris' job is extremely unique, studying astronauts and thinking about putting humans into space for long amounts of time and the future. The beginning was a bit of a plug for chris' book, but it gets better later on.  They jump into fun ideas at times, but not super well, and instead chris being focused on his stuff was best---science in space and aliens and thinking about the future of humans in space.  Bigger picture wasn’t as good, but not his/lex's fault.  Overall a classic good space/science intersection podcast.
