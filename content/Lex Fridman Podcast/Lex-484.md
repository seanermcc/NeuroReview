# Summary 
Lex and Julia vibe really well, and lex asks a lot of good questions that leads her into evil, memory, sexuality, and the enviornemnt.  But it did feel at times like alot of it was a book plug, and Lex didnt really push back hardly at all on her.  And for me, the talk on bisexuality and enviornment was a bit too much, and i disagree with alot of those points she made.  Plus on therapy i had the same issue.  But even with that, a ton of good was here and alot of really cool ideas about memory and evil and mental imagery made me think more then i thought i would with a cute blond talking :).  SHes sharp and interesting and nice to look at, which makes for a great vod-cast.  Would recommend for anyone interested in psychology and human nature.
