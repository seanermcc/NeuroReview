Way too short, and way not deep enough. While the conversation is still 'good' persay, I think relative to many of your other convos with physicists, mathemeticians, and cosmologists, this only scratches the surface. Some topics are barely glanced over and some powerful statements are lost because of the lack of depth.  This convo needs to be 2, 3, 4 times longer to be of high quality.
