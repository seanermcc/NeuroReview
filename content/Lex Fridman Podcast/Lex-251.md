They hardly talked about money, which was good I guess if you listened to the first one.  But standing alone, this felt a lot like a book endorsement.  Lex was (once again) very overhype and almost star struck about Ray, which made for a lesser convo then could have been.  They discussed very deeply (for a 1.5 hr convo especially) this cycle of power and empires, which they touched on in episode 1. But it almost felt too deep.  While I do like these kind of archtypes, I felt it wasn’t necessarily explained super well, and what I got out of it most was that Ray emphasized data in his book and with these archtypes, but didn’t really expain or talk about the data.  This could have been at least 2x longer, and would have made it more powerful and better.
