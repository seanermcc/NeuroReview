The power of the pause was deeply felt in this interview, where if you know the history between elon and lex, and lex with other hugely intelectual and thoughtful people, where they think deeply before saying profound things--elon is one of the best at this.  After everything you talked about for two hours turning into Elon opening up pretty deep.  Really neat to feel and see the humanity between these two somewhat robotic geniouses. Grok is really cool to work with and see and also just the fun that these guys have together, and the way Elon, the guy who just bought twitter, uses and enjoys twitter and Grok.  This is Elon at his finest and Lex as well, and might be a top 10 lex interview of all time out of the first 500.
