pod_notes: 'The uno reverse from robert back to lex on ''what is intelligence'' was
  a profound moment in this convo, lex''s pause and the fact that this kind of question
  (similar to ''what is money'' ) talking about seeminly fundamental ideas can have
  such complexity. Similar thing for ''truth''.--a great quote ''moralty has its roots
  in biology'' from an economist type of mind is also really great.  This is such
  a great length for this convo, and its really really good.  Another great quote
  (this episode is filled with them from both guys) ''arm yourself with knowledge,
  and study.  This is financial advice''. The depth and bready of this convo is everything
  i love about the lex fridman podcast, awesome. '
