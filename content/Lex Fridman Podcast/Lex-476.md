What a fantastic perspective on the mongols, from a clear expert who absolutely knows his stuff.  So much cool detail and personal stories and the expertise was s o pure, especially evident in the name recall and detail he went into.  Lex was able to have jack weave a story through the history of mongolia and tomujin (genghas khan), and then the kibloi kahn after him in china.  The ripples and waves of the culture that was created are evident worldwide, and this was the first time it was clear to me that the idea of trade and freedom worldwide and worldpeace were all pretty much invented and implemented at this time by the mongols.  His origin story was also so beautiful, and says a lot about the human spirit and the essence of humanity, which is not all about power/money like it sometimes appears when we look at governments and history.  Instead, this is such a human oriented story told by such an awesome human.  Another classic lex/historian crossover that was incredible.
