This was definitely good and full of tons of information, but it was definitely longer and tough to be engaging for all of it. They help cover lots of the general landscape of the “AI race” and its importance. It gives a lot of context for just what all is going on (semiconductor manufacturing and the surrounding industries, research labs, etc.). It gets particularly technical but is not necessarily overwhelming.
