Jordan and Lex vibe so well together--Lex reminds me of me or another young kid who starts to like Jordan from the wise, grandpa vibes he gives.  Whenever jordan is asked good questions, he just eats it up with some awesome thought and thoughtful answers.  Similar to how you see elon think, jordan does this but a little less extensively. The dive right into some deep religious questions about god and talk about this for about an hour.  They then get back into jordans deep and personal issues, lex likes this.  I thinks its interesting but at this point a bit mutch.  Would love to hear a 4-5 hour episode on meaning--maps of meaning and 12 rules of life reviews and commentary.  This is lex's cup of tea too.
