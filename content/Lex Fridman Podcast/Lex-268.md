Thinking about the good that came out of a think like the Nazi's and holocaust can come off as disrespectful and disgraceful. This man does it in a scholarly/thoughtful/deep way that creates a very interesting perspective of thought. This guy is what the D in DEI is truly meant for--a perpective that gets silenced over history.  The interesting medical, espeicially tabacoo and drug related, mechanisms of government and science are a very interesting dance behind the soul of Nazism. Proctor had to go into a lot of dark and lonely readings and papers looking into this shit, and amazing he can be so well spoken after all that.  He's definitely a classic history professor and these convos are all mostly 7+, and this one is good but I almost felt could have gone longer.  Talked about some weird/fun/crazy stuff in the middle with aliens and space travel, that was fun.
