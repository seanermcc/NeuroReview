Ryan is such an awesome speaker, and knowledgeable about so much more then just jui jitsu and fighting.  They talk about pretty much everything, politics, war, meaing of life, and especially jui jitsu and fighting as well.  They even touch on video games, Rogan and Alex jones, and a number of other ppl too (connor mcgregor and mike tyson).  So many relatable stories and metaphores, Ryan is such an interesting and cool guy. Felt so friendly and funny at times, but often very serious and profound.  This is an aweomse convesation and so interesting to really hear how the mind of a 'philosopher of martial arts' thinks and works.
