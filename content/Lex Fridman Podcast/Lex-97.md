This convo was a lot more focused than many of the future lex pods, which I think givin the 1.5 hour length was actually good.  Neat to think about a future where we have self (or semi autonomous) flying vehicles that take us from boston to NYC, a thought experiment that they talk about a lot here. Sertac is a very humble, honest, and clear speaker, but a bit of a nerd (in a good way).  The whol eidea of optimus ride was talked about in the perfect amount of detail and super cool, but interesting how this was 4 years ago from the time I've watched it and I still havnt heard much from this.  Seems like the timing of a lot of these kinds of ideas/companys is less on the scale of years and more like decades.  Would be cool to have him on again now and get more of his story and background and purpose.
