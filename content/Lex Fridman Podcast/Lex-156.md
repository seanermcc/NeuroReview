Tim is funny, as he is a comedian, but he is inspiring and insightful in the fact that he calls it how he see's it and doesn’t take sides.  He is honest, brutally at times, and is open minded and willing to be proven wrong.  This creates an interesting person who often see's the humor in the situations, or not just humor but how f'd up a situation is. They talk nicely about politics, conspiratory theories, and the impact that comedians and people and power have on the world.  This pod touches nicely on tims story and persona, while dancing through a variety of interesting and meaningful topics.  Humor sticks in at the perfect times, and this is a nice side of lex you get to see--the one that laughs.  A great podcast as lex often does with comedians.
