So this was just kind of weird because of how young these girls are.  Lex makes it kind of too comfortable, which would have been ok if they were older.  But lex should be more like a dad/uncle figure to them, and this convo made it like they were equals.  Besides that, the convo was ok.  Some good backstory about them, insight into their content and streaming and chess.  But I couldn’t get over a bit of the cringyness from the age difference.  Also a very strange start to ask them about their recent trip to italy...
