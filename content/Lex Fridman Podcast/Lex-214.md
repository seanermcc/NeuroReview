This was a bit too philosophical and all over the place to be too good, but a good conversation none the less. Jed striked me as a bit egotistical even though he studied this ancient scientists.  Felt like they were disagreeing at times even though im not sure they were. I didn’t really get jeds love or passion for what he studies, or even understand what he studied.  He just knew a lot about some smart guys.  They touch on conciousness and life and aliens in a weird/awkward way.  Ok convo, just not great.
