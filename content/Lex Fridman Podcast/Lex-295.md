Lex and Richard have a great and dynamic conversation, Lex does awesome with most anyone involved in Russian/European history/science. This is a better version of that, where we really get to see Lex speak on some of his ideas.  It was cool becase Wolff really disagrees/is in contention with many of Lex's statements and hashes a lot of these out with him in real time. Cool to see and watch lex gain some knowledge and enlightenment about history that he really cares about.  I actually wish this would have been longer and we could have gotten more into Richards schooling and upbringing and battles in academia. These are probably great stories that were only touched on here.  This is a upper tier 'Russia' podcast from lex, once again. Lets get Putin on.
