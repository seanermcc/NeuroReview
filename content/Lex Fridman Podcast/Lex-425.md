Listening is key is a quote from andrew at the end, and something you really want to hear from a journalist. If whoever is asking the questions is open minded and listening to both sides, then you don’t have a bias or agenda. Really interesting to get to know Andrew, his clib to fame in youtube (Mr. Beast vibes) and making a movie, some of his issues especially with attempts at being cancelled with sexual assault allogations (and his accountability is beautiful).  Making videos and conent and its such a natural convo. Seems like they are great friends and real genuine humans to eachother.Talks poltics without getting too polictical. Interesting jabs and stabs at the mainstream media. Somehow comes across as very wise for a young person who was addicted to drugs/alch with mental health issues.
