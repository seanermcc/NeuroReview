What a great overview and nuance of the 2024 election and politics in general. Saagar is such a well spoken individual, and well read, but also not too much so where he cant have opinions and common sense. I could feel some more maturity from here than in the last time I heard him on Lex--I think the election helped harden him (or he became a father since then lol).  The reference back to american and historical politicians was always so great—makes me want to be like this in my field (and shows what its like to be well read). The talk on immigration was great, on podcast as a source of media was great, and into the history and future of dem/rep parties.  A great convo, and he should come on every election cyle to discuss issues with lex.
