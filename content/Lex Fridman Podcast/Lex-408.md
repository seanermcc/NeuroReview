Tal is a very interesting person, and gives off similar vibes as Rick Ruben, Dan Renyolds, and other singers/creators. It seems like she see's the world and words and songs as something more than what they are, and that there is a skill or a feeling that is required to make good music. The starstruck vibe from lex and talking how great she is comes off a bit weird in this episode, as if you are like me you probably dont know Tal, so thats kind of wierd.  But they do discuss some very profound mental health and especially 'facing the demons', i.e. adressing concerns and issues in your life when they arise.  But also thinking about how to be a creator and make things  really comes across in a valuable way and perspective, in the idea that it takes alot of work but also confidence to put yourself out there.
