Wow, chris is an interesting dude and his story and life is made for a podcast.  So many gems throughout, in terms of life advice, impactful things in his life, and insights into not just strength training, but business, hard work, and mental health as well.  Lex does a great dance through his life, especially in first half, and this convo was so organic, natural, fun, but also deep, engaging, and enlightening that its really exactly what you want from a lex pod.  If your into strength of any kind (physcial or mental) this pod is for you.
