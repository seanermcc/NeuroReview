Lex started this with the giant 'can we cure all disease' question, which feels a bit naieve and I think got them off to a bad start. Then they talk about disease for 15+ mins before getting into AI and then finally 30 mins later coursera.  Starting with coursera and that journey and story would have been much powerful, and it would have been great to get more of Daphne's career arch and depth of her personality and character.  Instead the questions were a bit broad and Lex felt a bit out of his own character--given this was pretty early on his pod journey make sense.  But still felt a little surface level on most points, and lex found himself later on asking what he felt like were bad questions.  Daphne handled this a well as she could, but even his meaning of life question was prolonged and awkward.  Think you should defnitiely HAVE DAPHNE ON AGAIN and really dive into her journey and phychology and personality, as it does appear she is a fascinating person.  Just didn’t quite come out in this short convo.
