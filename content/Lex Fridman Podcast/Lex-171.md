An army guy, smooth talking, and even a little humble ‘bitcoin maximalist’ (although he doesn’t call himself that.  But only relatively humble to other bitcoin and economist types I’d say, mainly because he is just a regular guy at heart.  I love how he simplifies most of these complex ideas, and just sticks to the optomoism and hope that bitcoin is the best for future.  And even though that was the focus of the convo, lex does a great job getting into Anthony’s soul and who he is as a person, making this extremely relatable.  I love the start diving into his army background and 9/11 story, and you get to see a bit of his drive.  And then while they go into a lot of definitions and specifities of economic ideas, they stay often surface and above surface level into philosophical and bigger ideas throughout, making this great to follow.  This is a great one to get into for both entertainment and to learn about bitcoin.
