Much different experience listening to Hotz this time around (though I suppose I knew a bit more of what I was in for). The arrogance still somewhat shows, but I am starting to see more of his perspective with his companies and the mission is really just to create competition against technology monopolies - which is pretty admirable amid the perceived arrogance. It becomes more apparent in #387, but he’s really just trying to prevent some singular technology entity from defining industry standards - he wants to push all of technology forward and understands that there needs to be competition for that to happen.
