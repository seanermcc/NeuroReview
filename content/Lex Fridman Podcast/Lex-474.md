DHH is a really awesome, cool, and genuinely good person. Sure, he was a bit intense and passionate at times, but for a non religious person the holy spirit was clearly guiding this man through life.  From his career, to his wife and kids, to his racing car hobby, it all feels so good and on a path towards selflessness and sacrifice instead of ego and power. His love for his family was so strong and beautiful, especially for a CS guy. This episode was espeically cool because it had bit ans pieces of the class ‘lex + cs guy’ stuff (like whats your fav setup), but wih a lot of meaninful wisdom and life lessons and family throughout, which made for a really rare combo.
