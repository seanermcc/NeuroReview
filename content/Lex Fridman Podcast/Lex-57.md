Rohit was a cool guy, and he really loved loved loved Alexa. I wish lex would have asked him about negativs. This felt like a great convo mostly, but it was heavily biased twards alexa as the future or home robotics. I think more on AI, more on other robotics, more on the philosophy and psychology of alexa, would have really made this good convo great. The insights of alexa and the team and their thoughts were cool and interesting and this convo was focused on this the whol time, so a bit niche.
