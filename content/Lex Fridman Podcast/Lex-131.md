Chris is a very smar and well spoken computer scientist focusing on software development.  This makes it hard for me to give a nuanced rating, but as an outsider there was still a lot to take away from this convo. The way that he thinks about the nuances of development—with an open mind and with a focus on tradeoffs, is powerful and beyond just software. Without saying it, he emphasizes diversity. Then they have some nice philosophical type discussions about remote work, Chat GPT, and the simulation hypothesis that were really fun. So for someone interested in CS and the nuances and details of language design and compliers and swift (the language he created) this is a must listen. For a normie, id say get through the first half if you can (maybe on 1.5x) and then listen to the fun back half with more attention.
