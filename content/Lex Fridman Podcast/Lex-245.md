Something is off here—lex is without a suit, and the pod is way too short with a not big name.  But it makes sense given that lex had siad he recorded it years ago, and thinkin of the arc of him as a person and a podcaster it makes sense that this is how he started.  The conversation itself was ok, but too short. The passion lex has for wrestling comes out a bit, but it could have been much greater. I also would have liked to hear the olympic video drama some more. But they touch on some interesting topics and ideas around coaching and motivation and winning/losing that is nice. But not long enough to go deeper or broader. Would have liked that with tom, seems like an interesting person I’d like to learn more about.  Would recommend having on again.
