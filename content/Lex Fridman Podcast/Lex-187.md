pod_notes: 'Really cool and fun convo between what we would think of as a ''nerd'',
  but you make him seem so cool. And he is.  And especially referencin ghis books,
  not letting Frank get too bogged down with complicated and wordy topics, and going
  all over.  I only wish you got a bit deeper on some topics, especially his nobel
  prize experience and what its like being a scientist and trying to keep humility
  in light of fame.  '
