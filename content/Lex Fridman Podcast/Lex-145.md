Mathew is the face of the empirical science of pscyhadelics, right up there next to robin carhart harriss.  Hearing the breadth of his work and knowledge and passion from a three hour convo is very enlightening, and if you are somewhat interested int the science of pscyadelics then this is for you 100%.  Espeically if you’ve used them before, or just dabbled, or are thinking about it.  They didn’t do as much  mechanism as I like (that’s what hub is for), but a nice dance into conciousness, meanng, addiction, purpose, and society.  Lex was a bit too AI here as I thought it was unnecessary to bring up, and had a few weird things like saying ‘I could kill you’.  Besides that, all good and would recommend.
