Good episode, lots of good and interesting discussion around the role of advertising in business-consumer relationships. It’s funny how dated a lot of the discussion became with the emergence of TikTok and more short-form video content applications and advertising mechanisms. There was also some super deep mathematical talk that went completely over my head, and I usually have a decent grip on a lot of the mathematics covered in Lex interviews.
