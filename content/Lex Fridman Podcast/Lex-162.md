Jim is such a unique, wise, funny, yet still nerdy guy that vibes really well with lex.  In this convo, they talk a bit less over our heads (compared to the first) but still a little, and lex does a good job keeping Jim realed in to relatable a simpler ideas. They don’t get too bogged down on anything for too long, jumping around the spectrum of relevant comp sci and AI issues, then to broader societal issues and relating them back to neural netoworks and engineering, and then even to conciousness, love, and advice (my and lex's favorites at end).  Jim and lex seem to have a little more fun and laugh here, and this was a better quality comp sci focused epsiode from lex.
