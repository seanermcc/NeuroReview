Jim is such an interesting character--gives off the vibe of a electrician or plumber who's been doing things for too long. He defeinitely knew his stuff, was very opinionated in a interesting way, and just showed that the assumption of a nerdy programmer isnt always true.  I like the depth of the many topics they discussed, was never too in the weeds for me to be lost.  But would have loved more of his story arch and life included, and some more knowledge of the actual things he did.
