Strang is a really cool and such a normal guy, giving off such humble and kind vibes. This is exactly what you want from your professor, but you hardly ever see in todays top education with so much research and cutthrout attidue everywhere. You could feel the joy to talk about the big impacts of math, his influence on the white house, and his love for teaching.  But this was much too short for a lex pod, and lex apologizes for getting ‘philosphical’.  Would have loved so much more of this from Strang, as his kind and wise nature is perfect for new lex.  I hope he can come on again before he passes, as it was obvious he was really old at this time.
