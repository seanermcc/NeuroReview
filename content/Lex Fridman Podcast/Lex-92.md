Harry is 100% the kind of guy you would want working on the LHC.  He knows his stuff, can talk about it, abut is also so deep in there where he recognizes it gets really theoretical and crazy really fast and tries to stay above water.  But this topic itself is just a bit too technical and these kinds of particles are just so non intuitive.  I like the discussion of the higgs and b quarks, but the rest was just way over my head.  Lex does a good job of trying to siplify the ideas as best he can, and discuss the data and analysis and realities of the overall project well. This is a great episode for someone interested in theoretical physics, but if not might be hard to listen through (took me 3x to feel like I even got anything out of this).
