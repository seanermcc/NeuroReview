Michael is such a cool guy, and gives off cool rich uncle vibes. Keeps a nice high level discussion of bitcoin without getting too lost in the weeds, and makes his points known and relevant to most anyone.  Makes a lot of cool historical references as well—george washington dying of extra blood, and relating that to economics.  His personal storiy is also pretty cool, being an aeronotical engineer and then getting into finance and economics.  Lex does a good job guiding michael through interesting topics and michael is just such a confident, exciting, and attractice person and voice that makes for a great podcast. His stories about business and information and big ideas make them sound easy and possible for anyone.  Loved his advice to youngsters.
