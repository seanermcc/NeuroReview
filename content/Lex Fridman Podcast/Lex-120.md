This was a really good and rigiours convesration that looked into AI, machine learning, and the interesection of intelligence and what that means for society and technology. The convo never got too technical for an outsider, (which was really nice for me), and stayed mostly philosophical/big picture relevant. They got into a bit of nuances of intelligence tests, but this made sense and flowed nicely into Franciois work at doing an unbiased and rigorous test of intelligence (ARC). This conversation overall was pretty good, and somewhat specific, while being broadly interesting.
