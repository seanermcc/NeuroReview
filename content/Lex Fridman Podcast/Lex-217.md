Brooks is an interesting guy--a kind of toughness, honesty, and power comes through him that makes you realize how he could be someone who started something like iRobot and be the mind behind roombas and the future of at home robotics.  He wasn’t quite like a lot of the other scientists who do AI and robotics, wasn’t as nerdy persay. This made for an interesting style of lex convo where some of the questions where short answered and not as deep as usual, and then others had cool stories and persons (from MIT for example) involved that made it get deep.  I think Lex did a good job of hiding his ‘fanboy’ attitutude until the end, where this can make for an awkward style of thing, except for when he kept calling him ‘legendary’, even to his face (I don’t like that, it’s a bit cringe).  But this is a good convo for anyone interested in robotics and AI or compsci or MIT.
