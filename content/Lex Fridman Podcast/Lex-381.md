This conversation was very technical, and a bit in the weeds with making a programming language.  I felt like it could have been a bit more AI specific, but that is maybe discussed in previous convos with Chris. Most impactful part of this convo is the idea that this is the 'evolution of a programming language' and that the way Chris and the Mojo team go about doing this is not by improving python, but by looking at the 'capability of physics' and then seeing how close they can get from there.  More of us should have this attitute when improvising or desiging and think about what the limits are instead of just improving what is there.
