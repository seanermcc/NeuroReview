This was a really nice conversation between lex and michael, a bit less silly and sarcastic, and a bit more real and deep and thouhghtful, which made it actually more fun and interesting then previous (or other) episodes with him. Getting into WW2 and hunger and starving hit michael to his core, and he broke down.  This was wild to see, knowing him and Lex and their relationship.  They dove elegantly through the darkest times in history, and came out on the other side through governments with a beautiful anarchist perspective.  They touch on politics and love, but stay focused on government and power and their friendship.  This was highly entertaining, insightful, and emotional, and a great lex podcast for anyone who is already or becoming a fan.
