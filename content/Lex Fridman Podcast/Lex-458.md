Divingg through woke ideaology, trump, elon, DEI, AI, and zuck, made for a good and timely conversation given trumps new transition. Had a great south park reference (the underpants gnose), which was interesting and wild that he lets his young kids listen… I don’t love how political this conversation is overall, and it saddens me to see lex diving into politics so hard when it’s a bit controversial in the space of science and tech and AI.  I didn’t really get a political vibe from Marc hearing him on Huberman and Lex before, but this threw him into the right wing camp, almost sadly. Besides the political angle, the conversation overall was awesome and insightful and relatively open minded. But at times it was a bit too blunt and hateful and could be viewed as ‘right wing propoganda’ type of a vibe in the wrong hands.  Wish lex would have pushed back harder on some points. They touched on media and podcasts which was really nice, and big and little tech and scensorship, which was also all nice.  So a lot of good things, but left a bit of a sour taste because of the politicized nature.

    Some pros I didn’t focus on in the comment above, is that this was a great dive into problems with government, academia, society, and immigration.
