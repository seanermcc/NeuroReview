'You are a world class scientist in this space'--cmon lex quit sucking her off and ask better questions.  Plus she is just a little too...idk PC? Annoying?  Bad at telling stories? Jumps around too much? Has a little more fun at the end, but at beginning talking about bias and predigous--why?? Just cus she is black?  Lets hear her thoughts and hopes and dreams and get to know her a bit lex.  Don’t love the flow of this chat, felt a bit awkard especially 1st half, and doesn’t ask many fun big pic questions at end.  Advice?  Life? Death? Aliens?
