Guido is hard for me to listen to and get engaged with, it was the same way in the first episode.  Allthough this one did feel a tiny bit more big picture and fun (espeically) towards the end, it felt like almost the whole time they were in the weeds of computer science and python.  For anyone outside of CS and not a coder, it was too much.  These podcasts with guido to me could be an interest/entrance place for someone who thinks they want to get into CS.  If they can listen to it and pay attention and be interested the whole time, they should give it a shot.  But if they lose interest many many times like I did, because of the lack of excitement and passion (which ive felt from many of the CS people ive interacted with), then this might not be for you.  An ok pod for a CS nerd, but too in depth for a regular person.
