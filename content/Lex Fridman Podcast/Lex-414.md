This is a very timely and good podcast given tuckers recent (~2 weeks prior) interview with putin.  They spend a good chunk of time (~1-1.5 hrs) talking about putin and russia and its nice to hear this side of tucker, considering whats maybe being said about him on media.  Lex could have been a bit tougher on him, especially when tucker was talking shit on john stewert, but he calls tucker out a few times especially about the supermarket, and actually makes tucker realize and apologize/adress his weaknesses.  Interesting to see this live.  But I feel that some of the distasteful or rude things tucker does were not talked about, especially later, when Lex talks about politics and trump and what not.  It may have been nice to nail more into what tuckers political views really are and what his morals/opinions are and how these are related.  But very nice to hear this perspective just after the Putin inerview, which is first of its kind in 2 years.
