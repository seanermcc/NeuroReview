Lex dove hard into the cancer thing—both her science and her personal battle—right away.  This made for a good story and a nice hook to the conversation. But it failed to keep up with this energy, as it got a little dull and out of focus later on.  Don’t get me wrong, this was still interesting and nice and even cute a bit but a little random at times and not a great flow like the next 5-10 pods in the series.  Still interesting perspectives on data, bioinformatics, and the future of AI and machine learning. It felt that this was almost not niche enough and could have used more diving into the topics, and a bit more length.
