Is it possible to be non-partisan while being anti trump?  I think fiona makes a case for it. She has a really cool backstory that lex divers right into, and it takes a little while to get to the interesting part but it ended up being worth it. She gives a great perspective on ukraine and war and putin, but then gives some classic dem vibes on trump.  Lex even asks for pros and she still craps on him.  But besides that, she was very nuanced and suprisingly non partisan in a lot of her ideas and theories and people she likes/supports/is supported by.  This is an interesting discussion great for anyone wanting a detailed and insider perspective on putin and the ukraine war,
