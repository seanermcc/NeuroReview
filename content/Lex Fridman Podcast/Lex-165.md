This convo started off really hot and interesting—diving straight into philosophy and phsychology and freud with no hiccups.  This was suprising given the title, Josh’s background, and what he looks like.  And it stays good like this for 30-60 minutes, so loved the first half.  Then lex gets annoyingly fanboyish, they keep talking about rogan, and talks too much about movies and non philosophical and deep stuff.  What about the meaning of life? Death? War?  This would have been great to dive into with Josh, instead you talked about books and movies for too long.  Was a good podcast, especially to start, but ended poorly.
