Tick another one off for Lex and his Ukraine/Russia Saga, as this episode goes great right after the conversation with Tucker.  Its similar but spoken with so much more fact and truth and objection, and gives what feels like a more realistic and world view vs. the 'America first' tucker view, which is also somewhat subjective.  The deep history of ukraine and russia is emphasized and a number of signifigant historical events that I've never heard of are mentioned.  It’s a very good perspective considering what is going on and Lex's history, and this is a classic and historical Lex episode.
