Sergey is a very well spoken computer scientist 'nerd', but can speak at a normal level and explain things very well.  He made some great analogies, especially connecting to Lex's glacier idea, and also his own about broken plates, to describe some complex ideas.    He was clearly very thoughtful about Lex's questions (which were well done and less added on then other pods at this time).  Something that really came out from this was Sergeys excitement to the idea of 'understanding intelligence', and how that is the main goal of his work studying robotics and machine learning. He gave off a very humble vibe, and was a really good guest.  Would have loved a longer podcast, and feel that this is an underrated conversation.
