This was a somewhat cringey masculine pod, especially for lex, but with someone the age of your grandpa.  Lex lets his bro out here like I’ve never really seen. Asking a bit of raunchy questions about boobs and sex, makes this I think negative for most women.  But for a man, this is a bit funny and a lot of interesting insight, espeically about porn. This was very similar to the huberman pod with David in that so many sex differences and such a scientific way to talk about sex and sexuality. I felt like David let his walls down a bit here which was somewhat cool, and gave a little insight to his own life and meaning and advice, all good. Lex kept it on topic and focus which was also nice.  Pretty good convo, but a bit too raunchy to be rated much higher.
