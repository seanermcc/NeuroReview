Ian was a class image comp sci dork/nerd, but in an awesome way. Explained things in a lot of detail, but not necessarily too much for someone outside of the field (me) to understand.  However, lex kept asking some technical questionst hat dove a bit deep and lost me at times.  I did enjoy some of the higher level, more philosophical questions a few times--conciousness, and at the end about them both being robots and the turing test.  But they dive deep into GANs and do a nice dance about generators vs. discriminators--this idea was explained pretty well and applications were interesting.  But the convo was still a bit short and too detailed for me to love it and follow along the whole time (I had to listen to 2x to understand).
