'Vision is more fundamental then language'---1:09  Lex--'Gotten chance to interact w/ very smart ppl who are worried about AI'-a bad question from lex, his questions ran on and were not clear overall this podcast.  Lex asks ok questions, but not great, and feels like he interrupts or goes on to long to ask some questions.  But as far as to a fundamental on computer vision with some bigger picture psychological references--for example children vision and brain development, was really good.  So I feel 30-45 mins was really worth listening to, but not the entire thing.  Then felt it was  a little short on that fron--who were the people he mentored?  What kind of big questions did he ask?  What is the meaning of life?  Do you think about death?  Should have on again and ask bigger darker deeper questions.
