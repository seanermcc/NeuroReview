Welcome to NeuroReview! ---Created by Sean McCracken, Ph.D. 

I am a Neuroscientist and Podcast Enthusiast, where I have watched and rated 2500+ Hours of Scientific Podcasts since 2020.  NeuroReview is my mission to share this knowledge with the general public, with the hope of inspiring young scientists through long-form conversations about science and science related subjects.  

The mission of NeuroReview is to provide a curiousity toolkit for scientific minds, allowing people to gain confidence and competence in scientific ideas and feel that they belong as a scientist in classrooms, seminars, labs, or anywhere where scientific ideas are discussed.  Anyone can ask a good question.  Anyone can be a scientist.  These podcasts will prove it.  

All podcasts watched/listened to are rated 1-10, to 2 decimal points.  This rating system is inherently biased, but on a large scale should hopefully prove helpful to lead you towards more exciting/entertaining episodes.  All episodes are categorized as well, and rankings based on ratings for each category are provided.
