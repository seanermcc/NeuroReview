# Review
This was my first listen of the MBB (Mayim Bialik Breakdown), and i really like that its in person--im a bit biased with that.  Makes for a really engaging and exciting conversation to watch, which i did on youtube.  I had already listened to janna on lex, and loveeed her, so i was a bit biased.  And i dont like the 2x hosts.  But the dude didnt ask many quesitonst until the end, and many of the questions for Mayim were also good and steered Janna on a nice path through the solar system and into black holes.  I felt they didnt really talk too much about aliens or life, so the title was a bit misleading, and i loved that part of the convo with Janna on Lex.  But this was still good.  i actually liked the breakdown at the end and thought it was cute--made it relatable to be like oh, this scientist was also overwhelmed by her.
