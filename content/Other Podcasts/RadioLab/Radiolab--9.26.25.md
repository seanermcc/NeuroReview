# Review
This is very short, and a overly casual style of conversation with somewhat overly technical and biological statements. This was not overly produced like the 'voice' episode i watched, and rather it was a bit low level to start.  But i felt it was very misleading focusing on proteins as these magical and key pieces of biology for signaling--as a neuroscientist i felt like electrisity, neurotransmitters, and neurobiology were being completely overlooked and thus it was very hard to listen to and enjoy for the first 5-10 minutes.  Then the claim that every cell is making light seemed wild, but when i looked into it it appears to be true.  This was a cool esxperience, and i went from being kind of upset and thinking its BS to being proven wrong--so could say this was a bit of a rollercoaster of emotions.  But still, was too short and it took me until i saw Nirosha was an actual scientist and looked her up til she had any credentials--her voice and demeaner was just a bit too childish and silly.  Plus the host did not help her.  So the ideas were interesting here, but just not delivered great and with a really short podcast, its not that good, but not too bad.
