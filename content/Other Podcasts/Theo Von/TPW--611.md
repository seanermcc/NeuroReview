# Review
So i had heard Louis with Theo years ago, and remember the conversation being similar (especially the first 1.5 hrs)  Great vibes, mix of funny and deep and emotion and sex (given both of their issues/addictions)  But then they got deep into it, and shit go real.  Theo crying, saying some beautiful stuff about Louis' mentorship and leadership and then Louis' being the same greatful to Theo.  And opening up.  And crying.  And really just adressing the elephant in the room (really cloud over his whole life) with a great sense of remorce and even repentance.  A really powerful thing to see in action--this kind of thing is really only said and felt in confession booths or personal (deeply personal) conversations between loved ones.  Anyone who has battled with their own addictions, especially porn, absolutely can and would and should relate to this conversation.  A really great and deep and powerful dance along Louis (and even some of theo's) sex addiction.
