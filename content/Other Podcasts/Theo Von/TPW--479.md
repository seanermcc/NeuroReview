# Review
Theo and 'Dr Long' as he calls him often, were a great vibe.  Theo contained some of his raunchiness, but still had some great punches occasionally that really added some fun humor to this.  But really it got deep, spiritual, and theo was right on often even without being overly scinetific.  Sometimes its grteat to see how being insightful and meaningful can also be simple.  From love, to race, to babies, this convo focused on NDE but stayed in this realm of afterlife and heaven elegantly.  A great convo for anyone who is curious about NDEs and heard of them, but maybe not the best place to start.
