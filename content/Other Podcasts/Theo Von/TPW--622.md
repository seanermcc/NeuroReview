# Review
This was a bit short and a bit shallow of a conversation for Theo--although it was still pretty good.  Took a little bit to get more into Miles life and backstory and interesting stuff, and there was some good comedy throughout (especially the Tobacco + Dare thing).  It felt very natural and flowed well, just didnt get to the heart and soul of miles enough, and when it started to it ended really soon.
