# Review
The and Neil really vibe well, with a great combination of humor and science and serious and fun.  Theo asks a lot of random questions, and often tries to get into space, but instead Niel takes the more personal topics (like his marriage and upbringing and texas) and goes into great detail, while still keeping science there.  I personally loved the egg story with children--let them experiment.  There was a nice discussion about gender and spectrums--based on theo's question of 'is space gay'.  Those two points summarize this podcast perfectly and this is a great beginner science podcast for someone who already likes theo or other comedians.
