# Summary
Huberman and Tom really hit it off, and something clearly makes Andy comfortable enough to open up about science, the future of science, and the problems with it and the NIH in a way that I have never seen before.  I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years, but never coming out all in one conversation like this.  Additionally, the zoom in to Only fans was another somewhat controversial and intense conversation that I had never seen from Huberman before (even with following him for almost 4 years now).  This is a great starter for someone who is familiar with podcasts but not seen huberman yet--especially a young male.  And if you already like Tom and Impact theory--this is probably a gem (id think a higher/highest rated podcast, but we'll see!).
