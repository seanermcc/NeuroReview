# Summary
Knowledge of klnowledge can help onself intervene in your life--brilliant for education and kids and this is great to say.  A bit heavy on dopamine specifically, I think you could have branched to more interesting mechanistic stuff or other systems/neurochemicals. Like you hardly touched on light and sleep i think and on your other podcasts (especially when you are a guest) these are big hitting 'Huberman Classics'. Talking about sex and goals and motivation is really gold i wish you would have told more about your own story like tom does, dont be afraid to be vulnerable.
